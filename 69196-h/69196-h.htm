FOREWORD
</p>

<p>
All the world knows the tale of the Rising
of 1745.  It is a story that each generation
cherishes with undiminished affection.  Some
have called it the last burst of chivalry in
modern history, and doubtless for that reason
when other more vital aspects are forgotten,
the campaign of Prince Charlie will sustain its
fascination and its glamour.
</p>

<p>
In an age peculiarly commonplace and sordid,
it carried the spirit of romance well-nigh to
the throne itself; in a period almost destitute
of loyalty and patriotism it glorified the
reckless gallantry and self-sacrifice of devotion.
</p>

<p>
That Charles Edward Stuart could land
with only seven followers and carry all before
him into the very heart of England is wonderful
enough.  But that in the days of his misfortune
and flight no one was found to claim the
reward for his life is finer still.  That poor,
unarmed, uneducated men were ready to die
in hundreds is a testimony not easily forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Of those great days when the Jacobite
army marched south much has been written,
and the facts are familiar to all.  But of
those grey days following Culloden Moor
less is known, and in the last fluttering
of the Jacobite Cause there is much that
must necessarily baffle and perplex the casual
reader.
</p>

<p>
The Highlands were to a large extent divided
in opinion.  There were Jacobite clans, and
Hanoverian clans, while between the two were
men like Major Fraser of our story, anxious to
keep clear of both.  There were devoted chiefs
like Lochiel, scheming chiefs like Lovat, chiefs
who wavered and trifled like Macleod, or
were downright traitors like Glengarry and
Barisdale, and there were the tragi-comedians
like poor Murray of Broughton, who was more
hated than he deserved.
</p>

<p>
Finally there were, like poppies in the grain,
the adventurers, men with nothing to lose and
something to gain (such as Muckle John himself),
serving no chief, nor clan, marauders more
Jacobite than Hanoverian, like birds of prey
hovering for the kill.  It is of this side of the
'45 that I have principally treated.
</p>

<p>
Clan jealousies again must not be forgotten,
and the universal hatred of the Campbells
played, as always, its miserable part.  Those
who condemn Cumberland and his troops must
not forget that in the persecution after Culloden
the hunting down of the fugitives was ardently
pursued by the Highland militia and the men
from Argyllshire.
</p>

<p>
The story of a campaign is but a lightning
flash in the history of a nation.  Long after,
the thunder rolls into silence.  The Rebellion
of the '45 was only the fuse that destroyed
at a blow the clan system of centuries.  From
Culloden onwards the transit of the old into
the new was swift and tragic in its coming.

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
HOW PRINCE CHARLIE CAME TO INVERNESS
</h3>

<p>
It is often your stupidest boy who is most
likeable in a helpless sort of way.  Not that Rob
Fraser was a nincompoop, but there was a confiding
innocency in his shadowless blue eyes that
only a rascal could have turned to his own
advantage.
</p>

<p>
Rob was not accounted promising at school,
and during the study of such subjects as Latin
and Greek his mind appeared to be focussed
upon the next county, nor was he regarded as
reliable at games, for his movements were in
tune with his thoughts, which were more often on
the trout in the pool than on the ball in his hand.
</p>

<p>
It was this abstraction that divided him from
the other boys of his age, not because he was
unpopular, not because he lacked pluck, but
just because he was silent for days at a time,
and made no confidences.  It was a state of
mind that drove his aunt, good woman, to a
kind of arctic fury.  For years she strove to beat
it out of him, but it served no purpose except
to send him upon the hills for days together.
</p>

<p>
There comes a time when you can't beat a boy
larger than yourself.  Not that Rob would
have complained or refused to submit.  He
was indifferent to such things.  He had plenty
of spirit of a dogged and inflammatory character,
but it did not lie that way.  If it consoled his
aunt to beat him, then let her do so by all
means.  For all he knew it might be the
time-honoured custom of maiden aunts.
</p>

<p>
Miss Macpherson was, above all, a practical
woman, and it was Rob's dreamy obliviousness
to facts that fretted her.  To sit watching
muirfowl for hours together was more than
any sensible body could tolerate.  And that
was Rob all over.  He knew where the two-pound
trout lay in the burn up in the hills.
He could bring a curlew from the next glen in
a perfect frenzy of agitation to learn what
was the matter.  He would spend nights
together watching fox cubs playing under the
moon.  But of school and its tasks he had no
tolerance.
</p>

<p>
He was lying on the bank of a stream that
spring day when it all came about.  He did
not hear the footsteps nor did he see the shadow
on the water, but of a sudden there stood a very
large and pleasant gentleman beside him, dressed
in riding clothes, and with a handsome claymore
at his side.
</p>

<p>
"Cuddling?" said he very affably.  "I
mind the day when I could lay the bonnie ones
in rows upon the bank."
</p>

<p>
Rob stared at him with his ingenuous eyes.
</p>

<p>
"It is fine to be young," went on the strange
gentleman, "but there were no days like the old
days."
</p>

<p>
"Why do you say that?" asked Rob.
</p>

<p>
The stranger suppressed a smile at his eager
curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"They have said that," he replied, "since
Robert the Bruce heard it from his grandfather."
</p>

<p>
"But were the old days so fine?"
</p>

<p>
"Fine enough," he replied absently; "fine
enough and yet none sae fine either&mdash;there
is a bit tune I'm minded of..." and he took
a curious little instrument out of his pocket
made of reed, shaped like a piccolo.
</p>

<p>
Then sitting upon a rock he played a
tender little air with one eye glued to Rob to
see how he took it, and his head cocked very
drolly upon the side.
</p>

<p>
"There's the 'Brogues of Fortune' for ye,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"Is it a very old tune?" asked Rob, greatly
taken with the gentleman.
</p>

<p>
"As old as the hills, laddie, and that's past
counting&mdash;as old as the burn and the shadows
on the brae, for it's part and parcel of them all,
just strung together by mysel'."
</p>

<p>
"You made it?"
</p>

<p>
"Hech! there's nothing to skirl about.  I
make them all day.  I canna eat my dinner but
my feet are dirling to a tune that has no name
and must have the go-by until I have a spare
moment.  Make them indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"What else do you do?" asked Rob,
in his innocent blunt way.
</p>

<p>
The stranger laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I can hear the owl passing over the brae
in the night, I can see the stag hunkered amongst
the crags, I can catch the otter at his play."
</p>

<p>
"Can you call the weasel from his hole?"
asked Rob.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe I can," replied the other, "but try
you first."
</p>

<p>
At that, getting rather red in the face, Rob
uttered a thin squeal such as a wounded rabbit
gives, like the squeal of a rat for shrillness.
Again and again he made it, but nothing
moved in the broken place under the bank.
</p>

<p>
"None so bad," said the stranger, and distending
his lips he sent forth such a screech
that it froze Rob's blood.  In it was the terror
of the chase&mdash;the fear of what was following,
and the drawing of blood.
</p>

<p>
And before their eyes, not four feet away,
at the very first note the lithe form of a weasel
leapt quivering upon the heather.
</p>

<p>
"It takes a deal of practice," said the stranger
gentleman for fear he might seem overproud.
</p>

<p>
But Rob was utterly crushed.
</p>

<p>
Back dived the weasel for his lair, and lying
down, the stranger told Rob of the ways of wild
things until it was dusk.  Presently without so
much as a good-day but only a nod he buttoned
his coat and crossing the burn set off up the hill,
and Rob saw him no more, at least not for two
full years and over, not indeed until the Jacobites
came to Inverness in the year '46.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was about nine of the clock on the morning
of February the 18th, 1746, that two horsemen
rode into the town of Inverness.
</p>

<p>
Now there might seem nothing strange in that,
but rather in the manner of their coming, which
was at a headlong gallop.  Rob Fraser, hurrying
to the Grammar School, had scarce time
to leap aside as they careered up Church Street,
their beasts in a lather with sweat.  Rob gave
them one quick glance as they thundered by,
noting that one had lost his hat, and the other
his stirrup-irons; that both horses were fresh,
grass fed beasts new from the fields, and then,
on swift, light feet he sped in pursuit.
</p>

<p>
The Grammar School saw little of Rob
when promise of news was going.  For it must
be told that in the year 1746 Inverness was in a
rare tumult, and none knew just how the future
lay.
</p>

<p>
In August of the preceding year Prince
Charles Edward Stuart had landed in Scotland,
had won the clans to his banner, had defeated
the Government forces at Prestonpans, and
had marched into England.  Receiving no
support in the south, he returned to the north
with his gallant little army.  Then came the
second victory at Falkirk, and the retreat towards
Inverness with the Duke of Cumberland on
their trail.
</p>

<p>
It was at such a time that two horsemen
galloping recklessly through the streets of
Inverness were bound to create a commotion.  None
could say what would befall within the next
few weeks.  Inverness was Jacobite by
instinct; but there was no pleasant flavour
about the word "rebel."  In truth, the good
people of the town were at their wits' end to
know which way to cry.
</p>

<p>
But not so Rob Fraser.  Despite the opinions
of his father, despite the sour words of Ephraim
Macaulay, the schoolmaster, and the dour face
of the minister&mdash;Rob Fraser was a Jacobite
beyond recall.
</p>

<p>
For a boy of sixteen he was slightly built,
but lithe and wiry as a hill-fox.  His hair was
longer than is customary to-day, and covered
by a broad blue bonnet.  His features were
regular and clean-cut, the eyes dark and sombre,
his cheeks and neck tanned by wind and wild
weather.  In his rough jacket and faded kilt,
with his torn and patched stockings and his
soaking brogues, he made a queer enough
spectacle&mdash;not one would say the ideal picture
of a hero of romance.  He wore no sporran,
such luxuries were not for him, and his kilt
was but a roll of tartan belted about his middle,
but he carried himself with all the dignity of
his race.  He was a schoolboy, but out of school
he was a Fraser, and were the Frasers not in
the field with the Master of Lovat?  Those
were days when schoolboys had small time for
lessons.  Only the night before Lauchlain
Macintosh had eluded the sentinels and given warning
of the plan to capture Prince Charlie at Moy Hall.
There was no speaking to Lauchlain at the
Grammar School for months after.  Indeed,
things were too critical for sums and tags of
grammar.  Already the Prince was threatening
Inverness.  At any moment there might be a
battle at the very gates of the town, and who
could say what might happen then?
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the two horsemen had pulled
up their steaming beasts in the market place,
and the one who had lost his hat raised himself
in his stirrups and shouted for silence.  Rob,
worming his way through the people, arrived
in time to hear his opening words.
</p>

<p>
"We have ridden hot-foot," the man cried,
speaking in Gaelic, "for the Pretender's army
is even now marching on your town."
</p>

<p>
At that there was a sudden clamour of voices,
some cheering, and not a little hooting, for
the name "Pretender" was not pleasant in
Jacobite ears.
</p>

<p>
But Inverness was in Hanoverian hands,
and so the noise died away, and all eyes were
turned again upon the man on the horse.  He
was a great, red-faced fellow, very pompous
and self sufficient, and had his hair not looked
so laughable through the loss of his hat, might
have impressed his auditors enormously.
</p>

<p>
The news he had brought sent a strange
stir through the town.  People began to talk
in little clusters in the roadway, taverns quickly
filled with gossipers, shutters began to rattle
together, and anxious faces peered round the
corners of windows.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly down the street sounded the tramp
of feet, and a score of excited eyes were turned
in the hope of seeing the Highland army
march into the town.  But no&mdash;it was the
Hanoverian garrison some two thousand strong,
commanded by Lord Loudon, about to evacuate.
At that the confusion grew more intense, and
ardent Jacobites could scarce refrain from
donning the white cockade, while less ardent
Hanoverians did not know whether to cheer
or take to flight, and honest tradesfolk wore
long faces thinking of their goods, for who
could protect them against wild, Highland
caterans, hungry from long marching?
</p>

<p>
Rob slipped from group to group, listening to a
word here and there, feeling a bitter contempt in
his heart for these people of streets and shops.
</p>

<p>
The Hanoverian soldiers had passed out
of Inverness by midday, and crossing the Moray
Firth retired into Ross-shire, and still the
clatter of voices went on, and here and there a
group of men were walking the streets with
claymores at their sides, ready for the arrival
of the Prince.  At last Rob Fraser, grown
weary of idling, turned in the direction of the
school, and stealing inside the doorway was
astonished to find it very quiet and empty,
and with no sign of boy or master.
</p>

<p>
Of that master, whose name was the strange
one of Ephraim Macaulay, something must be
said.
</p>

<p>
He had arrived in Inverness three months
earlier, on the introduction of the Lord
President Forbes, and his predecessor had been
asked to retire.  The whole business was very
mysterious.  Some said the old schoolmaster
(who was a whole-hearted Jacobite) would
return, and others that he was in disgrace with
the Government, and counted as a conspirator
for the Stuarts.  At any rate, Mr. Macaulay
appeared, and from the moment he had entered
the place Rob had hated him with all his heart.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Macaulay was an exceedingly tall, thin
man, very straight and smileless, with a long,
hatchet face.  He was decently dressed in black
clothes, and wore silver buckles on his shoes,
but there was something strange in his manner,
and in his secrecy, and there had been rumours
that he saw overmuch of Lord Loudon.  In his
aspect there was a strong resemblance to a
hawk, through his habit of staring unblinkingly
into space.  For minutes together he would
stand thus, and then of a sudden he would
start and stare keenly about him with his
sombre black eyes, and awaken, as it were,
to his duties, which he seemed to find utterly
irksome and dejecting.
</p>

<p>
Rob went on tiptoe into the room where he
was in the habit of listening (somewhat absently)
to the words of Ephraim Macaulay, and crossing
the floor, peered into the shadowy passage
which led to the schoolmaster's study.
</p>

<p>
The door was ajar, and from the room
beyond came the sound of voices, a low grumble
in deep undertones, as though two men were in
close conversation&mdash;and very full of it.  He
heard a chair fall as though a man had sprung
to his feet, and while he hesitated
Mr. Macaulay cried "Muckle John" in a tone of
surprise and agitation.  "In Inverness," replied
another voice strange to Rob.
</p>

<p>
Rob turned to steal away, but even as he
did so the murmur of voices ceased, and before
he could make off, the study door was flung
back, and the long arm of the schoolmaster
shot out and clutched his shoulder.  It was so
quickly done that he could not even duck for
safety, and before he could shake himself free,
the master's companion had cut off his retreat
and gripped his arms.  He had been caught
eavesdropping.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Macaulay glanced at Rob with unmistakable
malice, then, springing to his feet,
he laid hands upon his cane.
</p>

<p>
"What have ye heard?" he asked sharply,
but with anxiety written all over his face.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," said Rob stoutly, "I did not
know there was any one there."
</p>

<p>
"Come, Rob," said the master speaking with
a strong lowland accent, "I'll leather ye for
eavesdropping if for nothing else," and he
began slowly approaching, his fingers twitching
at his sides, moistening his lips with the tip
of his tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Are ye ready, Rob?" he said, passing
round the table, his head thrust forward, and
a grim smile upon his face.
</p>

<p>
The boy took a step backward, so that a
stool lay between them, and flung a glance
about him for a way of escape.  To his back
lay the fireplace, and to his right the open
window, but high up and so small that only
a cat could have reached it and passed through.
</p>

<p>
"You've learned your new trade quickly,"
said the stranger with a chuckle.  It struck Rob,
desperate though he was, as an odd thing to say.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the schoolmaster had begun to
slowly unbutton his coat, and to turn back
his shirtsleeves.  His companion had seated
himself near the door&mdash;to leave ample space
for what was to come.  The seconds were
flying, and still Rob stood, his eyes darting
hither and thither, until suddenly they rested
upon the wall above the fireplace.  Now
an ancestor of the former master had been
a man of some prowess, and it was his claymore
which hung over the mantel-shelf, and so
fascinated Rob's eyes.  The basket hilt hung
down to within three feet of his arm.  Could
he but reach that!
</p>

<p>
Slowly Mr. Macaulay folded his coat and
laid it down.  He relished this prolonging of
agony.  It was never his way to have done with
a thing.  He even waved the cane a little,
the better to find its balance.  And then with
a swift spring Rob had leaped upon the stool
and gripped the sword upon the wall.
</p>

<p>
Uttering a cry of rage, the schoolmaster
sent his cane whistling downwards, but it fell
short, and with a great wrench, Rob ripped the
claymore free, and sent it whirling in a circle
about him.
</p>

<p>
And at that moment, far away, rising and
falling, the flaunting skirl of the bagpipes
came floating in through the open window.
For a moment they all stood like people in a
tableau.
</p>

<p>
"The Pretender!" gasped the stranger,
springing up.
</p>

<p>
The schoolmaster let the cane slide from his
fingers upon the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" said he, eyeing Rob, "it's
like we'll postpone your beating, my lad."  He
gloomed a little with a heavy frown upon his
face, then slowly unlocking the door, he stood
aside for him to pass.  But when he saw
Rob still retained the sword he hesitated and
laid a hand upon the boy's arm.
</p>

<p>
"What's the meaning o' this?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"It means," returned Rob, with head erect,
"that I'm no pupil of yours, Mr. Macaulay&mdash;but
a soldier, should the Prince have me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he'll have ye right enough," sneered
the master; "he's nane sae many, and rope
is cheap.  Good-bye, my bonny recruit.  We'll
meet again belike."
</p>

<p>
Taking no notice of his words, Rob hurried to
the doorway and out upon the road.
</p>

<p>
The clangour of the bagpipes was filling the
narrow streets and the cheers of the townspeople
rose and fell as the Prince's troops
marched past.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the volume of sound grew deafening,
and hats were flung into the air on every side.
For a moment he caught a glimpse of a young
man riding upon a bay horse who smiled and
nodded his head, holding his bonnet in his hand.
</p>

<p>
And in that swift vision Rob knew him for
Prince Charlie, for whom he was prepared
to risk his life.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
THE COMING OF MUCKLE JOHN
</h3>

<p>
The muffled tramp of feet went beating past
along the road.  That such an army should
have caused such utter panic to the English
throne and sent London into a condition of
wild terror, was amazing, and must ever remain
so.  Ill clad, poorly armed, ragged, gaunt,
undisciplined, it presented a spectacle more
like an assemblage of starved vagrants than
conquering soldiery.
</p>

<p>
Many were quite old men, many were stunted,
sickly creatures, coughing terribly as they limped
along.  Boys, many without shoes or stockings,
some not more than sixteen, made up a goodly
part of that desperate force.  Many of those
who owned swords had them tied about their
waists with ropes of straw.  Perhaps a third of
the entire force were capably equipped with
targe, claymore and dirk, while a number had
firelocks slung across their backs.
</p>

<p>
They may have been dusty, ragged, footsore,
but to Rob they were heroes of romance.  He
looked beyond their haggard faces and their
bleeding feet and shabby clothes.  They were
a veteran army as yet unbeaten.  They carried
themselves with the confidence of victory,
accepting the cheers of Inverness with the air
of men receiving their due.
</p>

<p>
Through a sort of mist Rob saw the tartans
swinging, looked into unknown bearded faces,
caught the glint of sunlight upon the cold
whiteness of steel.  The crowd about him began
to thin; the last of the troops had passed.
Already the road was a swaying, excited
tumult of people.
</p>

<p>
Now at the back of Rob there stood a tavern
owned by Major Fraser of Castleleathers, a
former friend of Lord Lovat, but fallen into
adversity.  He was a great rubicund man
some sixty-six years of age, and with no
particular interest in either Jacobite or Whig.
Rob knew him well.  Many a happy evening
had he spent listening to his stories of the great
days of long ago.
</p>

<p>
Major Fraser thought things had come to a
pretty pass when English troops were hounding
good folk about the country side.  Rob heard
him say so from the tavern door.  He was
standing on the top step staring with half-closed
eyes after the disappearing Highlanders.
Above his broad red forehead, his white hair
was fluttering in the quirky February wind.
</p>

<p>
"That you, Rob," he cried, "come your ways
in lad," and he shivered and stamped within,
Rob at his heels.
</p>

<p>
Inside the taproom there was a solitary
occupant.  He had evidently never stirred for
the tumult outside, for his legs were upon the
mantel-shelf, and his head was sunk upon his
chest.  All Rob could see was a very broad
back and a great red neck.  He took him to be
an exceedingly powerful individual, and one more
used to the saddle or the hills than taverns.
</p>

<p>
"Have they passed?" growled the man at
the fire, in a deep contemptuous voice.
</p>

<p>
"They have," replied Castleleathers, shutting
the door, "and Frasers amongst them."
</p>

<p>
"Like enough, and the Master but a boy,
James, fresh from college.  His father has
muckle to answer for."
</p>

<p>
"I ken fine, but who knows how this will
end?  I'd no break my heart if old Sim had his
neck thrawn...."
</p>

<p>
The man at the fire brought down his feet
with a bang and swerved about on his chair.
To Rob there was something strangely familiar
about him.
</p>

<p>
"Leave your bad debts to me," he said,
"I have a bone to pick with Lovat, and..."
then seeing Rob, his eyes narrowed and he
fell into a sudden silence.
</p>

<p>
"Whist!" said Castleleathers, "it's only
Rob."
</p>

<p>
But the other said nothing further, only
frowning at them both, and then of a sudden
he uttered a low whistle, staring over their
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Now the window was some four feet above
the ground&mdash;one single pane&mdash;and peering
through it was Ephraim Macaulay, the school-master.
For a single instant Rob saw him, then
with a bound the stranger was at the door.
He stood gazing up and down the street for
a moment, then returned.
</p>

<p>
"James," he said, "I knew I was right,
and when I see yon face I scent trouble brewing
just as surely as when the corbies come sailing
over the brae."
</p>

<p>
"It's the schoolmaster," said Rob.
</p>

<p>
But neither heeded him, and without a word
the Major took him by the shoulders and
pushed him out into the street, securely locking
the door behind him.  With the strangeness of
it all fresh upon him Rob clutched his claymore
and began to make his way homewards.  He
wondered where he had seen the great man in
Fraser's tavern before, or whether he had
dreamed of him.  The memory of him though
baffling, was curiously vivid in its way.
</p>

<p>
Rob lodged with his aunt, his mother's sister,
and was not ashamed to admit that he had a
wholesome terror for Miss Margaret Macpherson.
What would she say to his plans?  What, indeed?
</p>

<p>
Miss Macpherson was very tall and exceedingly
gaunt.  Her countenance was as bleak as
a wind-swept hillside, and there was a stony
glare in her grey eyes which seemed to turn
the very atmosphere to frost.  Her figure was
all points and angles&mdash;jutting out where her
shoulders rose towards her neck, and seeming
to extend indefinitely into her arms.  Rob
knew those long, sinewy arms with their thin,
gnarled hands ever ready to swoop.  Miss
Macpherson's customary attitude was like
that of a great bird of prey, mightily beaked
and clawed, pouncing swiftly, and rising again
to sit and watch upon a crag.
</p>

<p>
She was sitting before the fire as he entered,
and when she saw the sword in his hand there
came over her grim countenance a quick
change&mdash;a swift tightening, as though she had
received a shock but would not own to it.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Margaret," said Rob, with a rush
to get it over, "I'm marching with Prince
Charlie's men to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
She made as though to rise, then sat where
she was, only her hands trembled as she held
them to the fire.
</p>

<p>
"So schooling's over," she said, quietly,
"and now we're off to the wars, are we?  A
fine spectacle that will be for your father's son.
It's the gallows now, is it, along with a rag-tag
and a bonny Prince?  Ye'll want a polish to
this sword, I'm thinking, and some bannocks
for your travels.  Oh, I'll cook ye bannocks,
my mannie&mdash;fine, hot bannocks."
</p>

<p>
She watched him narrowly, all the time,
wishing to frighten him, and finding that he
remained unshaken she shrugged her shoulders
and set about laying the table, her long, thin arms
clutching the dishes.  Rob noted with dejected
eyes, that she was setting the things for one.
</p>

<p>
"How old are ye?" she asked at last, her
back still turned.
</p>

<p>
"Sixteen past," he answered, slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Aye," said she, "I suppose ye are."
</p>

<p>
She stared at him then with a queer look in
her face&mdash;as though she would have beaten
him had she been able.  Then, placing another
platter upon the table, she jerked her head at
him to sit beside her.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," she said, after a long silence, "to me
you have always been undergrown for your
years.  It seems but yesterday since ye came."
</p>

<p>
"It was eight years ago," he answered, still
upon his guard.
</p>

<p>
"So long?" said she, and took up her knife,
but eating nothing.
</p>

<p>
The meal proceeded in utter silence.  Rob
would have given a world to be away.  What
was in his aunt's mind he did not know, he
could not guess.  Her face expressed nothing,
only her eyes stared at him unblinkingly,
like the unfathomable eyes of an eagle.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," said she, at last, "when do you
get your marching orders?"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow, Aunt Margaret," he replied.
"You must not be grieved at my going; I
cannot bide here when my people are out.
Of course, we may not leave Inverness for a
while."
</p>

<p>
"Yon old fox, Lovat, is safe at home,"
she retorted.  "When the chief bides it is
not good for the clansmen to stir."
</p>

<p>
"But the Master is out," he hastened to add,
referring to Lord Lovat's son, who was in
command of the clan Fraser.
</p>

<p>
"It is the sly pussie sits on the top of the
wall.  Well, well," she concluded, "what's done's
done, and so off to bed wi' ye, and get your sleep."
</p>

<p>
Rob, concealing his delight at his aunt's
apparent complacency, rose to his feet, and
wishing her a very good night&mdash;for which she
thanked him grimly&mdash;betook himself to the
adjoining room, and flinging himself down on
his bed was soon fast asleep.
</p>

<p>
It was pitch dark when he awoke some two
hours later, and he awakened so suddenly that
he started up in bed listening intently.  Surely
somebody had spoken in the room!  But
there was no sound, only the crying of the night
wind in the street outside.  And then there
fell on his ears a muffled murmur of voices in
the kitchen, and a faint noise like the falling of
shoes upon the stone floor.  Stealing across the
room, he knelt before the door and listened
with a sudden dread in his heart.
</p>

<p>
For a moment he heard nothing at all, then
to his horror he caught the whisper of a voice
he knew too well&mdash;the shrill, nasal accents of
Mr. Macaulay, the schoolmaster, in close
conversation with his aunt.
</p>

<p>
So near were they both to the door that he
could hear every word they said.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you I saw him," said the schoolmaster.
</p>

<p>
"But what of that?  Every one knows that
old Castleleathers is safe as Mr. Hossack himself."
</p>

<p>
"Who cares two pins for Castleleathers&mdash;it
is the other I want..."
</p>

<p>
"Ye mean the big man..."
</p>

<p>
"That I do.  If I can lay hands on him I'll
fling a net over more rebels than if we had
Lovat himsel'."
</p>

<p>
"But Rob knows nothing of this.  He's only
a laddie gone daft over soldiers.  He'll have
forgotten all about it in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"Not he&mdash;but if he can tell me where one
whose name I'll no breathe to you nor to any
one else, can be found, I'll see his neck is safe."
</p>

<p>
"Then on wi' ye," whispered Miss Macpherson,
"for I doubt we must save Rob if we can.
Ye hae the rope."
</p>

<p>
"That have I," returned the master.
</p>

<p>
Then followed complete silence, and a second
later the faint creaking of the door behind
which he crouched.  Rob sprang to his feet,
and paused irresolutely.  He was unarmed and
helpless.
</p>

<p>
Very slowly the door began to open.  He
knew it by the draught of air upon his face.
In the pitch darkness he leaned close to the wall
waiting for them to pass him towards the bed.
</p>

<p>
But at that moment there sounded very
faintly, like the sighing of the wind&mdash;the far-off
catch of a tune&mdash;a little twisted coil of melody
such as the fairies dance to.
</p>

<p>
"Hold!" whispered Macaulay, in a low
tense voice.
</p>

<p>
"It is but a laddie's whistle," snapped Miss
Macpherson, "haste ye."
</p>

<p>
But he appeared to have a dread of something
in his mind.
</p>

<p>
"That is no boy's whistle," he replied sullenly,
"but the pipe o' Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
Then Rob could have shouted for joy, for he
knew in a trice who the great man in Fraser's
tavern had been, who but the stranger on the
moor who had lured the weasel from his lair.
Nearer came the ripple of music, and then
sounded a lusty banging at the street door and
a man's voice shouting for entry.
</p>

<p>
"Whist!" said his aunt, and again came the
knocking.
</p>

<p>
"Wha's there?" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"Open!" returned the voice&mdash;a deep bass
voice like the noise of a bull.  "Open in the
name of the King!"
</p>

<p>
"Better open, Mistress Macpherson," counselled
the master; "though I would I were out
of here.  If I had a sword, but who ever saw
a dominie with such a thing?" and he laughed
ruefully, while a furious knocking beat upon
the door.  Presently Rob saw the yellow light
of a candle, and heard the falling back of the
bolts.
</p>

<p>
A cold burst of night air rushed into the
place, and with it there entered a great,
formidable looking man, so tall that he must needs
bend nearly double to enter, dressed in riding
clothes, and with his hat rammed down upon
his face.
</p>

<p>
Rob slid into the room.  Beside him stood
Mr. Macaulay, the rope still dangling in his
hands.  His aunt was facing the stranger,
holding the candle high so that its rays fell
upon his face.
</p>

<p>
So they stood for a moment, and then the
stranger closed the door behind him, swung
off his hat, and made a sweeping bow.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-024"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-024.jpg" alt="&quot;MADAM,&quot; SAID HE, &quot;I CRAVE YOUR PARDON FOR THIS SEEMING INCIVILITY.&quot;">
<br>
&quot;MADAM,&quot; SAID HE, &quot;I CRAVE YOUR PARDON FOR THIS SEEMING INCIVILITY.&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said he, "I crave your pardon for
this seeming incivility; but I am new come to
Inverness, and am quartered here until to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
(Not so new-come thought Rob, mindful of
Fraser's tavern.)
</p>

<p>
All the time the stranger's alert blue eyes
were speeding hither and thither about the
room.  They paused for a moment on the rope
in the master's hands, took in Rob at a glance
(but with no appearance of recognition which
grieved him), and then returned to Miss
Macpherson, who had never acknowledged his
presence by word or nod.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," said Rob to the stranger, "Mr. Macaulay
was even now enquiring for you."
</p>

<p>
"Thank ye," he replied, "but I have already
seen the rope in his hands.  Maybe it could
be used for a better purpose..."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Macaulay was as near to the door as the
stranger.  With a bound he reached it, and flung
it back.  And then with another swirl of air
he was gone into the night.
</p>

<p>
The stranger watched his departure with
upraised brows and a smile upon his lips,
then he stepped to the door and closed it,
bolting it with careful hands.
</p>

<p>
"For the present," said he, turning to Rob,
"he's gone: You are not afraid of my company,
are you?"
</p>

<p>
He grasped him gently by each shoulder as he
spoke, and looked into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Rob shook his head.  Afraid of the man of
the moor!  He was suddenly overtaken by a
curious shyness of this mysterious man with
his shrewd, inscrutable blue eyes, his great
Highland nose, the whimsical twist that lurked
at the corners of his mouth, and his massive
head far up near the rafters through the vast
height of him.
</p>

<p>
His clothes had a foreign cut, and he betrayed
the inflection of a strange accent underlying his
words accompanied by occasional gestures of the
hands that strike a northerner as affected and
womanly.  His voice was very deep and soft
and so persuasive that few could withstand
him.  Even in anger it was never harsh&mdash;but
some said he never permitted himself to grow
angry and for that very reason always won his
own way.  Even Miss Macpherson only angered
him once.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the stranger was eyeing them
both with droll intentness.  If only the honest
can meet another's gaze without flinching
then he must have been a very honest man
indeed, for there were few he could not stare
down, and what is more take a relish in so doing.
</p>

<p>
"How are you named?" he asked, still
grasping the boy by the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"My name is Rob Fraser," he replied,
"and this is my aunt, Miss Macpherson."
</p>

<p>
"Then I am in good company," he said,
and letting go of Rob began to warm his hands
at the fire, turning them backwards and forwards
to the blaze.  "It is good," he mused after
a while, "to have peat reek in one's nostrils
once again.  What a bonny room this is.  There
are few pans like those in Inverness I'll warrant.
I would like fine to taste a bannock of your
cooking, Miss Macpherson.  I know a good
bannock when I see it, and it's long since I've
had a taste of old Scotland..." at which he
sighed and stared upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
Somewhat mollified, despite herself, Miss
Macpherson set the table again, and busied
herself amongst her household utensils.  Over
the peat fire a pot was swinging on a chain
from a cross beam above.  The place was full
of the rare smell of it.  But the stranger said
nothing, though he must have been eying
out for a basinful.  Instead he drew Rob to
the fire, and spoke to him in his low musical
voice, sitting upon a stool with his great coat
hung up upon a peg beside him and the steam
rising from it and losing itself in the blueness
of the peat reek.
</p>

<p>
"I saw ye the day," he said.  "It was just
after our forces, heaven help them, had passed.
I canna bear to look at them.  I feel like a man
watching a procession of bairns and dying
men..."
</p>

<p>
"Have you been in another war?" asked Rob.
</p>

<p>
"War," said he, "this is not war.  Man
Rob, I've served all over Europe and seen the
armies of Frederick advance like the thunder
of surf on a western isle.  I have seen service
in Poland, Austria, and the Netherlands.  I
have fought under Saxe."
</p>

<p>
He paused and seemed to draw some pleasure
from Rob's flushed face and eager eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Last year I lay before Tournay under a
starlit sky while all around me breathed
thousands of men who lay before many hours
on the field of Fontenoy.  That is war, Rob,
not skirling up and down the country with a
few hundred puir Hielan' bodies."
</p>

<p>
"But I am enlisting," he said, considerably
chilled by such words.
</p>

<p>
The stranger sniffed over the pot most
audibly.  The savour was more than a hungry
man could tolerate.
</p>

<p>
"You would make a rare campaigner, Miss
Macpherson," he said, "Rob is surely daft to
think of losing such a stew for all the thrones
of Europe."
</p>

<p>
"It is only an ordinary stew," she said,
with a faint flush on her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"It may be for you, Miss Macpherson&mdash;I'll
no deny it&mdash;but as a man not strange to stews
I'd call it by another name..." and he smacked
his lips and drew in another draught of it with
relish.
</p>

<p>
"Weel, weel," murmured Miss Macpherson,
and taking off the lid she set a knife into a piece
of meat and with a spoon she emptied the
gravy upon a plate.
</p>

<p>
"Draw in your stool," she said, and laid the
bannocks beside him.  Then after a momentary
hesitation she laid a round black bottle upon the
table.  "It is from Laggan way," she said.
</p>

<p>
"A bonny country," he replied, and without
delay set to with the greatest zest.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Rob drew near the fire, and laid a
peat or two upon the dying glow.  He suddenly
remembered how near he had been to falling
the prey to his aunt's schemes, and yet to look
at her face one would have said she suffered no
disappointment or resentment.  There was a
strong vein of fatalism in Miss Macpherson.
</p>

<p>
When the stranger had finished eating he
pushed back his stool, and wiped his mouth very
genteelly with a kerchief.
</p>

<p>
"And now, sir," said he, addressing Rob,
"what is this talk of the wars?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye," re-echoed Miss Macpherson, brightening,
"ye may well ask that, Mister..." she
hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"No matter," he replied quickly, "my name
will keep."
</p>

<p>
"I want to fight for the Prince," said Rob,
sturdily; "I have this claymore."  And he
brought it from the corner where it lay.
</p>

<p>
One look was sufficient for the stranger.
</p>

<p>
"Ye are a hundred years too late, my man,"
he said, regarding the rusty sword with a
critical eye.
</p>

<p>
"It is all I have," said Rob.
</p>

<p>
"And all ye are good for," retorted his aunt.
</p>

<p>
The stranger meanwhile sat with his chin
resting on one hand, a frown upon his face.
Of a sudden he stirred fretfully.
</p>

<p>
"What sort of talk is this?" he cried.
"To-morrow or the next day will see us scattered
like muir fowl; but we've had a run for our
money, whereas, you, poor lad, will have a
sair run for your life.  Bide a wee&mdash;there will
be other risings," at which he stopped, and
won a smile from Miss Macpherson for his
brave advice.
</p>

<p>
"Thank ye, sir," she said, cordially; "and
listen to the gentleman, Rob, for he speaks
true words."
</p>

<p>
Rob was about to break in when the stranger
motioned him to silence.
</p>

<p>
"Tak' your time," said he, "and choose
your ain gait, for there's a kind of empty
satisfaction in that at a time&mdash;and I will play
a bit tune, if I may."  At which he bowed to
Miss Macpherson, and she bowed back, and
that none so stiffly.
</p>

<p>
Then drawing the selfsame reed from his
greatcoat pocket that Rob had heard two
years before, he began to play, and the manner
of his playing was like the singing of a mavis
at twilight.  He played tunes both Scottish
and foreign, strange, melancholy snatches of
music very haunting to hear, and then, quite
suddenly, he broke into a Jacobite melody,
and Rob sat with eyes glued upon him, while a
great stillness crept over the place.
</p>

<p>
The fire had died down, and the room fallen
into darkness when he ceased, and it was only
to lay the pipe upon the table.  For out of
the silence came the most wonderful voice;
and the strange gentleman, rising to his feet,
was singing an old Highland lament as though
his heart would break.  Rob stole a look at his
aunt, and saw her lip&mdash;that iron, resolute lip&mdash;was
trembling.  Even the stranger's voice broke
through the utter sadness of it all, at which
he coughed and smiled, and then before Rob
could raise his eyes (it seemed to him to have no
beginning at all, so quickly was it done) the
stranger was upon his feet, and even while Miss
Macpherson was secretively concealing a tear he
had snatched up his whistle and was in the very
middle of a Highland reel.  With his fingers
rippling up and down the holes of the thing, and
the rakish tilt of his head, and the manner in
which he kept time with his feet, and his
shoulders and his whole body&mdash;with all of this
and the dancing firelight and the wind shut out
upon the street&mdash;the thing was like the work
of a bogie.  Had he been a little man with silver
buttons and silver-buckle shoes and a velvet
jacket, then there is no saying but that he
might have played himself up the chimney and
over the heather, with Rob and Miss Macpherson
at his coat-tails.
</p>

<p>
The music grew faster.  It grew wilder.  It
brought Rob to his feet and sent him skipping
and snapping his fingers in a frenzy.  The
stranger was here and there, missing notes
because he could not do everything at once, and
turn at the same time.  And then just when
the rant was at its height Miss Macpherson was
at it too, first skirts held daintily from the
ground, then arms akimbo, bowing, twirling,
spinning.  The stranger threw aside his pipe.
He sang the lilt of it instead, and so facing Miss
Macpherson they capered and linked arms and
clapped their hands and hooched until the
stools were jumping all over the floor and the
bannocks after them, and the table rocked
upon its legs in the corner.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my lad," panted the gentleman
after it was over, wiping his face, "have ye
settled the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir," cried Rob, "it's the Prince for me."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," said he, seating himself again,
as though he had guessed as much.
</p>

<p>
"I believe ye sang so on purpose," snapped
Mistress Macpherson, now thoroughly awakened
to the danger, and considerably ashamed of herself.
</p>

<p>
"On my oath, madam," he replied, "I
advised the lad against it&mdash;ye heard me with
your ain ears."
</p>

<p>
"But thae songs?"
</p>

<p>
"Tuts," he said, "what are songs?"
</p>

<p>
The dawn was already in the east, and a faint
grey light shone beneath the door.
</p>

<p>
With a start, the stranger rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"The day is near," he said, sombrely, "I
must be stepping"; and for a breath or two
he looked Rob in the eyes.
</p>

<p>
"And I, too, if I may go with you," said Rob,
casting a glance at his aunt.
</p>

<p>
For a moment she struggled with her anger,
then, taking him roughly by the shoulder,
she shook him.
</p>

<p>
"Go then," she cried, "but dinna say it
was with my leave.  And you, sir, do what you
can for him."
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said the stranger, wrapping his
greatcoat about him, "I promise you that."
</p>

<p>
"What name do ye go by?" asked Mistress
Macpherson, of a sudden.
</p>

<p>
He appeared for an instant slightly put about.
</p>

<p>
"The name I go by," repeated he, "is
Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
"That's no sort of name," she snapped.
</p>

<p>
"It's sufficient for me," he replied, and
touching Rob on the shoulder, they passed
into the street.
</p>

<p>
From far away came the shrill notes of many
bagpipes, and the faint stirring of assembling
men.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," said Muckle John, slyly, "I thought
you had forgotten."
</p>

<p>
"I knew you at once," said Rob, "but you
never looked at me."
</p>

<p>
"Did I no," said Muckle John, "maybe there
were reasons, Rob&mdash;there are folk would do the
world for a friend of mine, but there are others,
Rob&mdash;there are others."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
THE END OF THE JACOBITE CAUSE
</h3>

<p>
The position of Prince Charlie in Inverness was
exceedingly critical.  To the north lay the forces
of Lord Loudon.  To the east and south were
the Hanoverian army commanded by the Duke
of Cumberland now stationed at Aberdeen.  But
his position was rendered even more precarious
by lack of foresight in ignoring the advice of
Lord George Murray, and refusing to provide
a supply of provision in the Highlands.
</p>

<p>
Judging that the Duke would not advance
for some weeks, the Prince decided on the
reduction of various forts and positions held
by the enemy, and above all the destruction of
Lord Loudon's army.
</p>

<p>
It was arranged, therefore, that Lord Cromartie
(one of those incompetent officers who
handicapped the Jacobite cause) should advance
upon Lord Loudon in order that the menace
from the north might be destroyed, and this,
he prepared to do, accompanied by the
Mackenzies, the Mackintoshes, Macgregors and
others.
</p>

<p>
The preparations for this expedition were
under discussion when Muckle John and Rob
came into the main street.  For a while they
walked along in silence, Muckle John grown
suddenly gravely absorbed, and taking such
great strides that Rob was hard put to it to
keep up.  The dawn was come, and with it the
town of Inverness began to hum and buzz
like a hive of bees.  Men, quartered in every
house along the narrow street, commenced
to pour out upon the highway, some putting
on their sword-belts as they came, others
wiping sleep out of their tired eyes with their
knuckled hands.
</p>

<p>
It was the sight of their claymores that
sent Muckle John's flickering eyes upon his
companion.
</p>

<p>
"My lad," said he, stopping abruptly,
"there's one thing we must be seeing too.
For cutting firewood or driving bestial,* I have
no doubt yon weapon might serve as well as
another, but for the game of war it is
disappointing," and whipping out his own sword
he made a parry or two, and winked at him.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Cattle.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"What do ye think o' that?" said he, and
drove it home again into the scabbard.
</p>

<p>
"I think it's bonny," said Rob shivering with
the chill wind.
</p>

<p>
"Bonny&mdash;you Fraser loon&mdash;what kind of word
is that for the sword of Muckle John," and
without a word, he turned his back and began
to stride again up the street, snorting as he
went.
</p>

<p>
"But, sir," cried Rob, at his heels, "what
about me?"
</p>

<p>
"You," cried Muckle John in a huff, "what
indeed?"
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing of swords," said Rob,
anxious to appease him at all costs.
</p>

<p>
Presently Muckle John stopped and looked,
first upon the ground and then at Rob, and so
upon the ground again.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," said he at last, "had ye no better
take your ways home?"
</p>

<p>
"Never!" cried he.
</p>

<p>
Without a word the other turned upon his heel,
again, and so in a dour silence they reached the
centre of the town.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," said Muckle John, "you see that
house there?  That is where the Prince is
staying, and there at the door he is, and with
him Lord George Murray, a braw soldier but
no Irish, and so not above suspicion."
</p>

<p>
On the door-step stood Prince Charlie talking
in a vexed, irritated manner to a very
choleric-looking gentleman, who seemed in a bubble
of anger, which he could ill control.
</p>

<p>
"Come ye with me, Rob," said Muckle
John, "and keep your eyes open, and your
mouth as tight as a gravestone."
</p>

<p>
As they approached, the Prince let his eyes
rest on the massive figure of Muckle John,
then nodded absently like a man whose
thoughts are far away.  Lord George Murray,
on the other hand, greeted him with some
cordiality, and turning again to the Prince,
continued his conversation.
</p>

<p>
"I can assure your Highness that no aid will
come from France," he said, "Fitzjames is
captured, and that is not the last of it...."
</p>

<p>
The Prince gnawed his lip with bitter vexation.
</p>

<p>
"Your lordship was always most certain
in disaster," he said peevishly, "a long face
carries a long tale."
</p>

<p>
"Unless we drive back Loudon we are like
rats in a trap," went on Murray ignoring the
words.
</p>

<p>
"You forget Prestonpans, my lord."
</p>

<p>
The other shook his head fretfully.
</p>

<p>
"The men are tired and wearied of it all,"
he replied, "they want to go home&mdash;they are
not regular soldiers...."
</p>

<p>
"What would you say to talk like this?"
said the Prince, turning of a sudden upon
Muckle John.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," he answered, "your troops are
exhausted.  But in the mountains you could
resist the enemy until they recovered their
strength."
</p>

<p>
"But there is no money&mdash;no sign of men nor
arms.  What of France&mdash;what of the English
Jacobites?"
</p>

<p>
"What indeed?" said a low voice from the
doorway.
</p>

<p>
Looking down upon them all stood a young
man of about thirty&mdash;a thin, slight, anxious-looking
man dressed in black, carefully tended
clothes.  It was Mr. Secretary Murray, or, to
give him his full name, John Murray of
Broughton.
</p>

<p>
"May the English Jacobites not escape
their just punishment," he said gravely,
"should disaster await us," and he sighed and
stared out across the street.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I go north to assist Lord Cromartie?"
asked Lord George Murray, who hated Broughton.
</p>

<p>
The Prince frowned as though he would
like to know the inner purpose for such a
plan.  Then, seeing none but that of reason
and loyal service, and yet doubting the latter
very sincerely, he replied almost gruffly:
</p>

<p>
"We will see what Sir Thomas Sheridan has
to advise," whereat the countenance of Lord
George Murray grew dark with strangled rage.
For a man who had risked his life and fortune
and the lives of his people to be dependent upon
the whim of an Irish adventurer with nothing
to lose and everything to gain was enough
to ruin any cause.  Already the end of the '45
was in sight.
</p>

<p>
Muckle John bowed and drew Rob away.
A few minutes later Lord George Murray passed
them with a face like murder, bound for the
North.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe ye see now," said Muckle John,
"how the wind blows.  There goes as good a
soldier as can be, but ye'll find that whatever
he advises will be contradicted by any poor
Irish creature or Frenchman who may be
passing.  The longer Cumberland sits snug
in Aberdeen the more time will there be for
hectoring and desertion and the beginning
of the end.  Wae's me," he sighed, "I would
give something to be upon the quay of Dunkirk,
for there's nothing here for the likes o' me but
a rope with a bit noose."
</p>

<p>
The business of procuring arms for Rob
was next undertaken, and it was a proud day
indeed when he strapped a targe on his back,
and a claymore to his side.  He was attached
to Lord George Murray's flying column in
pursuit of Lord Loudon, and so on the evening
of that day he bade farewell to Muckle John.
</p>

<p>
The march north was uneventful, and in due
course, with only a victorious expedition to
his credit, Rob returned with the Duke of
Perth to Inverness and was dispatched into
Atholl with Lord George Murray's force.
</p>

<p>
During the succeeding weeks, the guerilla
engagements of the detachments in Atholl and
Lochaber were completely successful, while
in the east the Prince kept at bay the dragoons
of General Bland.  It is not fully appreciated
that the campaign around Inverness was no
less brilliant and successful than the other
engagements of the Jacobite rebellion.
</p>

<p>
But the war was nearing a crisis.  Cumberland
having waited for the spring, moved out
of Aberdeen on April 8, his force consisting
of six battalions of foot and a regiment of
dragoons.  At Strathbogie, General Bland, with
six battalions, Kingston's Horse and Cobham's
Dragoons, awaited his advance, while at Old
Meldrum were three battalions under Brigadier
Mordaunt.  In this manner the entire army
advanced on Inverness.
</p>

<p>
The swiftness of their approach was wellnigh
fatal to the Prince.  His troops were scattered
on foraging and isolated expeditions, while
Lord Cromartie was as far away as
Sutherlandshire.  Many clansmen had returned home
while a great number were wandering the
country-side in search of food.
</p>

<p>
On the morning of April 14 the drums began
to beat and the pipes to sound through the
streets of Inverness, and with Charles Edward
at their head the Highlanders marched out of the
town towards Culloden.  On the 15th the
Prince brought his army to Drummossie-Moor,
with a view to engaging the enemy there.
But the ground was flat and heathy and
unsuitable for the method of attack most favoured
by the Highlanders.  Lord George Murray
pleaded for more rugged and boggy country to
disconcert the English cavalry, but Charles,
tired of long waiting, was obdurate.  It was
decided that a night attack was under the
circumstances the wisest plan of action.  To
attack the enemy crippled in artillery and
cavalry work was on the surface a wise course,
and accordingly about eight o'clock on that
evening, Rob heard the order to prepare to
march.  It was with heavy steps that the
Highlanders formed up, for only one biscuit
per man had been served out that day and they
were utterly exhausted for want of food.  Moreover
it was regarded as unwise to attack without
the Mackenzies, the Frasers, the Macphersons,
the Macgregors and Glengarry's men, all of whom
were supposed to be hastening to Inverness.
</p>

<p>
However, the prospect of a night attack was
sufficient to send them along with good heart,
and so the twelve-mile march began, and all
through the black night tramped the silent
army, stumbling, falling, straying from the road,
until the dawn gleamed faintly in the east and
they realized that the plan had failed.  To
meditate attack under such circumstances was
to court utter disaster.  There was nothing for
it but to return.  The surprise had failed.  The
Prince, white and tired, seemed on the point
of tears.  All around him were haggard faces
and lagging feet.  Hardly a word was spoken.
It was in sober truth the retreat of a beaten
army....
</p>

<p>
The clansmen, now utterly exhausted, strayed
back to Inverness in search of food.  Many
dropped in deep slumber upon the ground.  In
Culloden House the Prince sat in the deepest
dejection.  Not long after news reached him
that the English forces were advancing.  Once
again the clans were gathered&mdash;messages were
sent to Inverness to hasten the stragglers&mdash;everything
was done to put as brave a face on it
as possible.  Lord George Murray again advised
taking up a position more suited for the Highland
charge, or retreating into the hills.  But
the Prince again rejected his counsel, and
instead of seven thousand fresh troops only
about five thousand exhausted men assembled
on level country to meet Cumberland's veteran
force.
</p>

<p>
To Rob, who looked on the Highland claymore
as irresistible, the approaching conflict
was none too soon, to others it came as a relief
after weeks of waiting and hardship.
</p>

<p>
Of that ill-omened day everything is known,
and little need be said: it was the inevitable
conclusion of a forlorn hope.
</p>

<p>
The English opened fire, and for long enough
bullets rained and sang through the sullen
Highland ranks.  At last Lord George Murray
resolved on an advance, but before he could
give the order the Mackintoshes, with the
heroism that had ever distinguished that clan,
charged recklessly, and at that all the regiments
on the right moved forward, and the action
began in earnest.
</p>

<p>
An aide-de-camp was dispatched to hurry
the advance of the left wing, but he was shot
on the way and this unhappy accident prevented
the Highland advance concentrating its
full shock.  It has long been an established
belief that the battle was lost largely owing
to the defection of the Macdonalds, who
refused to advance on a dispute of precedence.
It is time that a story without historical
foundation should be for ever discredited.
The Macdonalds did not receive the command
to charge until it was too late, and they found
themselves faced by an impassable morass
when they moved forward.  When the battle
was lost and the Prince in flight, they marched
from the stricken moor in good order.
</p>

<p>
The English soldiery meanwhile had awaited
the attack with levelled muskets and fixed
bayonets, reserving their fire until the
Highlanders were almost upon them.  At close
quarters they raked the close ranks of the
clansmen with deadly aim.
</p>

<p>
The carnage was terrible.  Whole ranks of
the Highlanders were swept away.  But it
took more than that to stem that mad and
dauntless charge.  It broke through Barrel's
and Monro's regiments, but farther they could
not go, for they received a storm of grapeshot
sufficient to decimate their numbers.  Had the
whole Highland line delivered its shock
simultaneously the English army might have recoiled
and taken to flight.  But the failure of the
extreme left to advance at all lessened the frail
chance of such a tactic proving decisive, and
within a few minutes the Jacobite cause was
lost.
</p>

<p>
Rob, placed on the left wing, weary of waiting
and sick at heart by the sight of men falling all
about him, unloosed his claymore, and pulling
his bonnet down upon his brows, prepared for
his regiment to charge.  At last they could
stand the shattering fire no longer.  With a
hoarse noise of shouting rising from Gaelic
tongues like the roar of a winter sea, they
streamed forward in reckless bravery, and foremost
of them Rob, running over the heavy ground
towards the storm and thunder of the conflict.
</p>

<p>
Already, however, the main body of the
Highlanders was wavering.  The first wild
charge had shattered their ranks.  The English
cavalry were advancing and some one shouted
that the Prince was killed.  Panic began to
do its work.  Soon after the left wing
commenced to march off the field.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p43"></a>
All about Rob arose hoarse cries, groans,
eddying smoke, and the roar and clatter of
arms.  Into the thick of the conflict he struggled
onwards.  He thrust and parried and thrust
again with his claymore.  Well for him was it
that his father had taught him the secrets of
a stiff wrist and the upper cut.  An English
soldier rushed at him red with battle madness,
and shouting as he came.  Rob, receiving a
blow from an upraised musket on his targe,
drove home his claymore and heard the cry
die out in the man's throat into a choking sob,
and&mdash;silence.
</p>

<p>
Then, before he could disengage his sword,
a dragoon, spurring his horse over the heaps
of fallen men, slashed at his head with his
sabre, and, missing him, pulled up his beast
and charged again.  For Rob the situation
was desperate, but seeing a little solitary group
of Highlanders near by, he took to his heels
and reached them, picking up an English
musket as he ran.  He was barely in time;
had not a huge Cameron armed with a broadsword
hewn down his opponent, it would have
fared badly indeed with him.  As it was, he
clubbed his musket, and standing back to
back with the others, prepared to fall as hardly
as possible.
</p>

<p>
The tide of battle swept backwards and
forwards; but all over the fatal moor the
Jacobite army was in retreat.  Gradually the
little group about him thinned, until only a
bare dozen remained, and it was in a
breathing-space that Rob suddenly perceived Muckle
John amongst them.
</p>

<p>
His head was bound in a piece of tartan,
and bleeding profusely; but the smile was in
his eyes, and his claymore rose and fell, and
every time a man floundered upon the ground.
Before him there lay a heap of Englishmen as
high as his elbow.
</p>

<p>
Presently the smoke of powder cleared a
little, and over the moor came a squadron
of dragoons at a loose canter, killing all who
stood in their way, both wounded and unarmed.
Round the little circle of faces Muckle John
looked swiftly.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said he, "it is each for himself,"
and he whistled a sprig of a tune as he began
to swing his sword-arm.
</p>

<p>
With a hoarse yell the dragoons were on
them.  Two fell to Muckle John, there was a
wild clash, and a man beside Rob dropped
with a groan.  And then came an oppressive
weight of horses kicking, plunging, rearing&mdash;and
a blinding blow flung him unconscious
beneath their flying feet.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was well indeed for Rob that death seemed
to have snatched him from the cruel hands
of his enemies, and the pile of dead and dying
about him sheltered his body from the search
parties of Hanoverians now busy upon their
work of butchery.
</p>

<p>
When at last he opened his eyes and stared
about him silence had fallen over the field&mdash;a
silence infinitely tragic and menacing, pent
up with disaster and following retribution.
</p>

<p>
Very slowly facts began to stare him in the
face.  Even he, inexperienced in the manners of
war and defeat as he was, realized with a shudder
that if he could not crawl away certain death
awaited him as it had met those silent figures
all about him.  The blow on his head throbbed
horribly.  He felt sick and weak.  At last he
made an effort to turn upon his side, and moaned
aloud.  Then suddenly he clenched his lips,
and dropped upon his face, for near at hand he
caught the tramp of footsteps, and heard the
harsh voices of English soldiery.
</p>

<p>
Nearer they came, until they halted beside him.
</p>

<p>
"None for Master Gibbet 'ere," said one,
and a chuckle followed.
</p>

<p>
"You never know," said another, and began
dragging the bodies this way and that.
</p>

<p>
A muffled groan came from one of these
unfortunates, and a moment later, to Rob's
horror, a pistol barked, and the same grim
silence fell again.
</p>

<p>
Then a hand gripped him by the arm, and
turned him over.  To feign death&mdash;that old,
hazardous device&mdash;was Rob's solitary hope.
He lay with closed eyes, holding his breath,
in an agony of suspense.  Second followed
second, and no sound reached him.  Stealthy
footsteps he heard, and a muffled laugh, but
nothing to warn him of immediate impending
danger.  So awful became the mysterious
nature of the delay that he could hold out no
longer.  Breathe he must, or he would burst
his lungs.
</p>

<p>
He drew in a long draught of air through
his nostrils, and in a flash&mdash;before he knew
what had happened, he had sneezed.  A roar
of brutal laughter greeted the penetrating
noise, and a voice cried out beside him:
</p>

<p>
"Two to one on the snuff, Jerry; I've
won the wager," and he was dragged to his
feet.
</p>

<p>
Rob opened his eyes now that the worst was
come.  He would meet his end as bravely as
he could.  Four English soldiers were seated
upon a pile of dead Highlanders, and another
held him by the arm.  He saw that there
was little chance of mercy written on their
brutal faces.  Memories of Prestonpans and
Falkirk were too sore for that.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my gamecock," said the man who held
him, "so you are not so dead after all.  What
shall it be?  A little bullet from a pistol,
or a dig with one of your own claymores&mdash;more
homelike that, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Rob kept silence.  He could not understand
a word they said in their queer, nasal
twang.  Vainly his eyes searched the desolate,
wind-swept moor.  The clash of battle was
long since past.  No hope of friendly succour
lay there.
</p>

<p>
"Haste ye!" cried one of the four men who
sat together.  "There is other work.  Pistol
him and be done with it."
</p>

<p>
At that the fellow who held Rob stepped
back a pace, and drawing his pistol, raised it
and fired deliberately at him.  Had Rob not
ducked it would have killed him as he stood.
</p>

<p>
"A miss!" cried the others, and with an
exclamation the man snatched a loaded pistol
from one of his comrades, and prepared to
finish the business.
</p>

<p>
Rob stood very still this time.  He was too weak
to run.  The sooner it was all over the better.
</p>

<p>
The man was poising the pistol in his hand;
he had shut one eye, and was glaring at Rob
with the other.  Already the trigger was moving,
when a stern voice shouted "Halt!" and an
English officer, very resplendently dressed, and
with a white peruke, snatched the pistol from
the man's hand.  The other four staggered to
their feet, and stood at attention.
</p>

<p>
The officer, whose back was turned on Rob,
appeared to stare for a moment at the soldiers.
Then, throwing the pistol upon the ground,
he folded his arms and began to speak with
a strong English accent, as baffling to Rob
as that of his captors.
</p>

<p>
"What does this mean?" he cried.  "Would
you shoot a wounded boy?"
</p>

<p>
"Our orders were no quarter," growled the
man who had so nearly killed Rob.
</p>

<p>
"Take your orders from me," thundered
the officer in a blaze of anger, "or there will
be more gibbets in Inverness than you had
reckoned upon, and with fine, red-coated gentry
upon them belike," at which Rob saw the
fellows stir uneasily, and cast apprehensive
glances at one another.
</p>

<p>
Apparently satisfied by the fear he had
put upon them, the officer pointed to a horse
wandering aimlessly about the moor, his reins
about his knees.
</p>

<p>
"Fetch that horse," said he; "my beast
was shot from under me an hour since."
</p>

<p>
Two of the men darted off, only too glad to
win his favour, and all the time the officer
stood with his back to Rob&mdash;a great, square
figure, with a broad tear across the middle
of his doublet and the long hair showing beneath
his peruke.  The soldiers caught the horse
without difficulty, and returned with it.  It
was a dragoon charger, a great grey, raking
beast, strong and sound.
</p>

<p>
Taking the reins in his hands, the officer
turned again to the men.
</p>

<p>
"Mayhap you cannot guess whom you so
nearly shot," said he darkly.
</p>

<p>
They shook their heads in an awed silence.
</p>

<p>
"Then ask in Inverness," he replied, and
vaulted into the saddle.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he went on, "hand that boy up
here.  He's no prisoner for such as you."
</p>

<p>
In a moment, two of the soldiers caught up
Rob and placed him in front of the saddle, so
that he sat upon the horse's withers.
</p>

<p>
Then gathering up the reins they walked
slowly away, leaving the soldiers at the salute.
</p>

<p>
A hundred yards passed and still they
maintained this idle pace.  Then suddenly
the officer leaned forward.
</p>

<p>
"Haud tight," he whispered into Rob's
ears in a voice strangely familiar, "for we're
no through with it yet," and with a plunge the
great horse sprang into a gallop.
</p>

<p>
"Muckle John!" cried Rob, nearly falling off
altogether.
</p>

<p>
"Aye," said he, "just Muckle John and
no sae happy at that."
</p>

<p>
Onward they rode at a headlong, tearing
gallop, until the ill-fated field of Culloden with
its heaps of huddled dead lay far behind them;
and passing the water of Nairn, made for
Aberarder and clattering through, thundered
onward to Faraline.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
FRENCH GOLD
</h3>

<p>
A thin moon was drifting above the scattered
clouds when Muckle John and Rob reached
the head of a wild and desolate glen in Stratherrick,
and here for the first time since their
flight from Culloden they drew rein and alighted.
So stiff and weary was Rob that his companion
was compelled to lift him down, and lay him
in the heather.
</p>

<p>
The horse, utterly done, stood with his head
hanging forlornly, and the sweat dripping
from his neck upon the heather.  Few
horses would have carried them both so
gallantly.
</p>

<p>
Muckle John had long since discarded his
English wig and coat.  He stood in his shirt
and with his hair fluttering in the night wind
regarding with sombre eyes the blinking lights
of a house down the valley, a square white
house two stories high.  Twice during the
brief halt a man had crept out of the encircling
darkness and scrutinized them narrowly.  There
was no sound beyond the wind sighing amongst
the corries, but each time Muckle John had seen
the heather quiver before something noiseless
and stealthy that disappeared as softly as it had
come.  Once from far up the hill he heard
a long whistle like a curlew on the wing.
</p>

<p>
At last he turned his head and let his eyes
rest on Rob, and then again upon the grey
horse with its drooping head.  With a faint
shrug of his shoulders he shook the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," said he, "do you ken yon house?"
</p>

<p>
With a groan Rob struggled up.
</p>

<p>
"Gortuleg House," he replied, "I know it well."
</p>

<p>
Muckle John of a sudden turned his head and
raised his hand for silence.
</p>

<p>
From far away along the track they had come
was a sharp click-clack like the rattle of a
loose stone on a horse's hoof.
</p>

<p>
"Ye hear, Rob," he whispered, "there'll be
few abed to-night.  Come away, boy, this is
a daft-like place to be found in."
</p>

<p>
From up the hill came the mournful whistle
once again.  It was answered by another far
down the glen.
</p>

<p>
"The place is hotching with Frasers," he
muttered, lifting Rob upon the horse, "and
where the Frasers are a man must feel his way,
saving your presence, Rob."
</p>

<p>
"They are our friends," said Rob stoutly,
"and my people."
</p>

<p>
"I'm no denying it&mdash;though maybe ye had
safer speak for yersel', Rob, but to-day will
end many a friendship, and I'm no trusting
Lochiel himsel' until I'm clear of this business."
</p>

<p>
Nearer they drew to the lights of Gortuleg
House, but the closer they came the more
cautious grew Muckle John, feeling his way with
immoderate care, and with a hand upon the
horse's nostrils for fear of a whinny.  To the
rear of the house there stood a wall with a
few stunted fruit-trees in an orchard.  In the
same anxious silence Muckle John hitched the
bridle to a branch and lifted Rob down.
</p>

<p>
"Bide here," he whispered, "until I come,
and if any one speaks to you say that you're
waiting upon Lord Lovat."
</p>

<p>
"Lord Lovat?"
</p>

<p>
"Who else?"
</p>

<p>
"But is he here?"
</p>

<p>
"Man Rob, I've no time to teach you elements
of common sense.  If ye see a wheen corbies
driving across the sky what do ye ken?"
</p>

<p>
"That there's carrion," said Rob to humour
his temper.
</p>

<p>
"And if ye see muckle muir-fowl cowering
among the heather?"
</p>

<p>
"A hawk."
</p>

<p>
"You're doing finely, Rob;" he paused and
leaning nearer added in a whisper, "I am
no sure but that the hawk is nearer than
ye think..." and with that he was gone,
leaving Rob beneath the shadow of the
broken masonry.
</p>

<p>
Barely five minutes had passed before the
thud of horses' flying feet came beating down
the glen.  The moon riding high in the sky
glinted on steel and silver, and at the commotion
the door of Gortuleg House opened and the
figure of an old bent man was silhouetted in
the doorway, leaning upon a stick.  He was
a grotesque enough spectacle&mdash;very ponderous
and unwieldy, large-faced and ruddy and with
shifty, speeding eyes almost buried in a mass
of flesh.  He was dressed in a loose coat, rough
baggy breeches and stockings, with large flat
buckled shoes, and as he peered and craned
his head he tapped in a fever of impatience upon
the flagged stone at the doorway.
</p>

<p>
A single ray of light made a yellow bar
upon the open space in front.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer came the racket of galloping
horses&mdash;the jingling of bits and scabbards&mdash;the
hoarse shout of a man's voice, and into the
lit space plunged a powerful roan horse all
dirty grey with foam and spent mud.  Upon
its back there sat a young man rocking with
fatigue and with his head uncovered and his
coat opened to the night wind.  The old man
standing in the doorway shuffled forward a
step and laid a hand upon his bridle-reins.
</p>

<p>
"Who are ye?" he asked in a shrill querulous
voice, "and what news do you bring?"
</p>

<p>
For a long time there was no reply, and in
the silence the candle in the old man's hand
fluttered desperately and went out.
</p>

<p>
"I am the Prince," said the man upon the
horse in a dull voice as though he were half
dreaming, "I am the Prince and..." his
voice trailed into silence.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-054"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-054.jpg" alt="&quot;I AM THE PRINCE,&quot; SAID THE MAN UPON THE HORSE.">
<br>
&quot;I AM THE PRINCE,&quot; SAID THE MAN UPON THE HORSE.
</p>

<p>
Round him in a half-circle the companions
of that wild flight were gathered&mdash;their faces
looking very dim and white like the faces of
ghosts.  For an instant the old man seemed
to shrink into himself.  His great head
drooped,&mdash;the hand that gripped the bridle fell with
a low thud against his side.  But only for an
instant.  There was within that disease-racked
body an energy that defied the penalties of age.
</p>

<p>
"Dhia gleidh sinn," he cried harshly, "are
you tongueless all of you?  Come&mdash;come in&mdash;would
you sit glooming there all night?  Your
Highness," he said, breaking off and looking
up again, "this is a wae meeting and like to be
our last...."
</p>

<p>
"You are Lord Lovat," said the Prince
with more life in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"It is a name," the old man replied, with
a sudden twisted grin, "that I would I could
disown."
</p>

<p>
A few gillies had gathered about the horsemen,
and when they had dismounted their tired
beasts were led away to an outhouse, and the
whole party followed Lord Lovat within.
</p>

<p>
Inside the room where they made their
way a great fire was burning.  A table stood
in the centre, upon which was a bottle of claret
and some glasses.  He had waited news for
hours back.
</p>

<p>
In the firelight Lord Lovat regarded his
visitors with sour displeasure.  Now that the
news of Culloden had come, and the first biting
terror over, he resumed his habitual demeanour
of inscrutable cynicism.  He congratulated the
Prince on arriving so soon, and poured out his
glass of wine&mdash;he asked the names of the various
gentlemen with him and expressed polite
ignorance when he was informed, only remarking
that he had always admired Irishmen because
they took so much interest in other people's
affairs.  And all the time he was cursing his
utter folly for having supported the Jacobite
cause and plotting, plotting, plotting in his
inmost mind what was the safest course to take.
</p>

<p>
Only once did his self-possession desert him,
and that was when the Prince said to Sir
Thomas Sheridan that they must make for the
Isles.
</p>

<p>
"Make for the Isles," he cried, glaring at
them like an aged wolf-hound, "what sort of
talk is that?  Will you desert us all and not
make a stand in the hills?  What is one
defeat?  You must make terms, sir, or you'll
have more to answer for than ever your father
had."
</p>

<p>
"It is no good," replied the Prince dejectedly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, why," cried Lovat, trembling with fury
and vexation, "did ye come and ruin us
at all?"
</p>

<p>
At that they tried to soothe him, telling
him that he had taken no part&mdash;that he was an
old man&mdash;that he could hide for a season.
To all of which Lovat shook his great head.
He never deceived himself.
</p>

<p>
"More than that," went on the Irishman,
Sheridan, pacing up and down before the open
window, "all is not lost.  The clans will
assemble again, and French gold is even now
on its way.  Gold," he added, "will unite us
again as quick as honour."
</p>

<p>
He smiled, little guessing how far he erred
in that while Lovat listened absently.
</p>

<p>
"French gold," he repeated, "and how
can they land gold now?"
</p>

<p>
"They make for Lochnanuagh," replied
Sheridan, "and...." but the Prince broke in:
</p>

<p>
"Come, gentlemen," he cried, "let us to
horse.  We must reach Invergarry before dawn.
There is no sleep for us yet awhile..."
and he raised his harassed eyes to the cold
sky.  "My lord," he said, a moment later,
taking Lovat by the hand, "do not give way
to despair&mdash;we are not beaten yet."
</p>

<p>
But the melancholy tone in which he sought
to cheer the old man went like a chill to their
hearts, and brought the old satirical grin to
Lovat's mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Farewell," replied the old man with all
the natural dignity that neither age nor
dishonour could rob him, "I doubt we shall
never meet again."
</p>

<p>
At that they all rose, and after shaking him
by the hand passed down the stairs.  He
accompanied them to the door and stood with
no further word while they mounted their
beasts.  The gillies letting the reins, fell back
into the night leaving him alone.  He took
off his hat, but made no other sign.
</p>

<p>
Of a sudden in the cold night there rang a wild
tumult of horses' hoofs and they were gone
as they had come.
</p>

<p>
For long Lord Lovat stood in the doorway
listening, with his eyes upon the black way
they had taken, and then shivering violently he
turned and stumbled upstairs.
</p>

<p>
Out in the darkness Muckle John crept from
the shadows.  He had heard all or nearly all.
He looked all around him and then stared at
the upper window of Gortuleg.  He could see
the vast shadow of Lovat seated by the table
waiting his fate.  For a few minutes he stood
pondering the situation, then on tiptoe he crossed
the track and opened the door.  Closing it
gently, he made his way up the narrow stairs.
The door to the room where Lovat sat was
open.  He halted in the passage and looked in.
</p>

<p>
On a chair before the empty fire-grate sat
the old man, his eyes fixed upon the floor, his
legs crossed his fingers intertwined.  His lips
were moving ceaselessly, and once he frowned
like a man frowns to himself who is uncertain
just what course to take.
</p>

<p>
At last he rose and made his way across the
room and to a strong box heavily clasped.  This
he unlocked and opened, extracting a heap of
documents and letters and laying them upon the
table.  Then setting fire to the peats, he began
to turn over the stuff, throwing some into the
flames and putting some back again into the box.
</p>

<p>
"A braw night to you," said Muckle John,
standing full in the doorway.  The paper the
old man held between his fingers fluttered
gently upon the floor.  Over his face there
travelled a grey tinge as though he had grown
of a sudden very old or ill.  But he never
moved nor did he say anything.
</p>

<p>
Entering the room, Muckle John closed the
door, and walking towards the fire set about
warming his hands in the coolest manner
imaginable.  Then taking off his great coat
he laid it over the window.
</p>

<p>
"On such a night," he said, "it is better
to do things quickly, my lord, and privately."
</p>

<p>
The old man answered nothing.  He seemed
struck dumb with fear, or rage, or some kindred
emotion.
</p>

<p>
"I take it from your little preparations
that you know how things stand."
</p>

<p>
"I was looking through some old rubbish,"
said Lovat more at his ease.
</p>

<p>
"I know what sort of rubbish," replied Muckle
John, extracting a letter before the old man
could check his hand, "how would this sound,
eh?  It's no what we might call cordial to
Geordie."
</p>

<p>
"I am an old sick man," said Lovat, with
a suspicion of whining, "scarce able to
read or write.  My memory is near gone and
my faculties all amiss.  What do you want
with me?  It is late and I have much to do."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps your lordship will remember
Castleleathers, who was once your good friend."
</p>

<p>
"What of him?"
</p>

<p>
"He did me a service abroad.  Yesterday
I was with him in Inverness.  He told me
much about you, my lord&mdash;and your promises."
</p>

<p>
Lovat shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"It is easy to listen to one side of a matter,"
he replied tartly.  "Castleleathers is a fool&mdash;I
have never suffered fools gladly."
</p>

<p>
"Even you make mistakes sometimes, my lord."
</p>

<p>
The fear of capture took Lovat by the throat.
</p>

<p>
"Aye," he gulped, "but this is no time to
quarrel.  Let bygones be bygones.  I did ye
a wrong long since, I'll allow, but surely
ye can forgive and forget?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Muckle John, "I never forgive
nor forget."
</p>

<p>
"Then what is it you want&mdash;is it my life&mdash;there
is little enough of that to take&mdash;or is it
money&mdash;I have a few guineas?"
</p>

<p>
"It is none of these.  If I wanted your
life I would set the red coats on you.  But
they will need no guidance of mine.  I want
to know where the gold is to be landed that is
coming from France."
</p>

<p>
"Oho," cried Lovat, "so that's how the
wind blows, is it?" and he remained deep
in thought for a while.
</p>

<p>
"Will you do something if I tell ye?" he
asked cunningly.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe and maybe no."
</p>

<p>
Lovat moistened his dry lips.
</p>

<p>
"There are sore times coming," he said
in his husky voice, and speaking in Gaelic for
the first time, "and I am not what I was.
There may be folk who will swear black is
black instead of white&mdash;you will be taking my
meaning?  Were I to fall into the hands
of the Government it might go badly with
me.  But there are ways...."
</p>

<p>
"And they?"
</p>

<p>
"I have not taken arms, though my son has.
They would never harm him being a mere boy,
but they might forgive his old father should
he hand him over.  It must happen one way
or the other.  But I cannot lay hands on him.
What would you say to that?  It is for the boy's
good&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Impossible&mdash;you are pleased to insult me."
</p>

<p>
"Then what will you do should I tell you?"
</p>

<p>
"I will not dispatch these letters to the
Duke of Newcastle."
</p>

<p>
A sickly grey colour crept into Lovat's cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"You would&mdash;you would?" he gasped.
"You would play into English hands, you
would sell me?"
</p>

<p>
"There was an occasion," said Muckle John,
coolly, "when you nearly did the same to
me."
</p>

<p>
"Long ago&mdash;long ago."
</p>

<p>
"In the year 1728 to be exact."
</p>

<p>
Lovat's eyes flickered over the strong box
and back again.
</p>

<p>
"How did ye know there was treasure?"
he said, to make time.
</p>

<p>
"You forgot to shut your window."
</p>

<p>
"You played eavesdropper?"
</p>

<p>
Muckle John sighed.
</p>

<p>
"The hour is late," he replied, meaningly.
</p>

<p>
"I am in your hands," said Lovat.
</p>

<p>
"Then tell me where the gold is to be landed.
I could not catch the name of the place."
</p>

<p>
The old man leant forward suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"It is on the coast of Knoidart," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"You swear it?"
</p>

<p>
"Such were the words that Sheridan said."
</p>

<p>
"It sounded unlike Knoidart, but I could not
hear."
</p>

<p>
"It was Knoidart."
</p>

<p>
For long Muckle John tried to read truth
or lies in his face.  But the expression of
Lovat was guileless.
</p>

<p>
"If you have lied," said Muckle John at last,
"I will hound you down."
</p>

<p>
Lovat gently drew the palms of his hands
together.
</p>

<p>
"Why should I lie?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Then good-bye, my lord, and look to your
papers, for to-morrow will bring dragoons
and..."
</p>

<p>
"Enough," broke in Lovat, "I am not afraid."
</p>

<p>
He sat perfectly still until Muckle John had
gone down the stairs, then with a grim smile
he set about sorting his papers.
</p>

<p>
"Knoidart," he chuckled, "it's little gold
would remain in Knoidart."
</p>

<p>
Out in the night Muckle John stood deep in
thought, then climbing softly over the wall he
reached Rob and the great grey horse.
</p>

<p>
"I must leave you for a while, Rob," he
whispered, "but I'll return, never fear, and
keep watch for the bit tune&mdash;ye mind the way
it goes&mdash;" and he whistled a bar.  "Keep on
the top of the hills, laddie, but mind the
skyline, and never stir by day.  It's advice easily
given but a weary business to follow," and
putting his foot in the stirrup he mounted and
walked softly down the glen.
</p>

<p>
A great loneliness stole over Rob, left as he
was in a country he hardly knew, and with a
throbbing wound, and a keen hunger on him.
Stealing round to the house he made his way
to the hall, and hearing no sound of human
souls anywhere he entered the kitchen and
happened upon a plate of cold porridge.  This
he devoured, and re-entering the hall he lay
down before the fire and fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
Upstairs Lovat crouched before the fire.
Hour after hour passed and still he spelt out
with his tired weak eyes the contents of one
sheet upon another.  Once he nodded and a letter
passed unread&mdash;a letter that was to weigh
in the scales against him later.  For an hour
he slept altogether.  But as the dawn was
creeping back over that stricken country, the
day following Culloden found him still bending
with a haggard countenance over his
correspondence, every letter of which might bring
him to the scaffold.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
At dawn on the same morning that saw
the Prince speeding westward and Muckle John
upon the road, before the moon had sunk behind
the hills, Rob Fraser stole out of the hall and
made his way into the open air.  Already
rumours were drifting through the village that
the English were on the march towards Gortuleg,
and all who were suspected of having taken
arms for the Prince would be summarily dealt
with, and their houses given to the flames.
</p>

<p>
Round the premises of Gortuleg dwelt the
same melancholy silence as on the night before.
Every living thing seemed to have fled.  The
very kennels were empty.  Only one shaggy
Highland pony whinnied in the desolate stable,
hungry and alone.
</p>

<p>
A grey mist was driving down the glen,
and a thin drizzle of rain had set in with the
coming day.
</p>

<p>
As Rob peered up at the windows wondering
what had befallen, he caught for an instant a
pair of eyes fixed upon him, and heard a noise
of shuffling feet.  Coming from that deserted
place it sounded so dreary that he was near
taking to his heels.  Before he could move,
however, the huge bulk of Lord Lovat loomed
into the shadowy doorway.  Leaning heavily
upon his stick with hunched shoulders, and a
face unshaved and the grey colour of chalk,
he stood with muttering lips.  Then shuffling
forward a step he stared blankly at Rob like a
man whose thoughts are far away on another
errand.
</p>

<p>
"What o'clock is it?" he rasped at last;
and pulling off his wig, patted it idly, and
rammed it again upon his head.
</p>

<p>
"Six o'clock, your lordship," said Rob, in
a great awe of him.
</p>

<p>
"Six o'clock!" He frowned suddenly, looking
all around him with pursed lips.  "Where
are my servants?" he cried.  And when no
answer came he quoted a scrap of Latin, and
chuckled as though the context tickled him.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," said he at last, "and who are
you, boy?"
</p>

<p>
"Rob Fraser, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Thank ye," he snarled, speaking in broad
Scots; "but it's a name as common as
muir-fowl hereabouts.  Why are ye no with the
Master, that unscrupulous rebel, my son?
Mind how I spoke of him, Rob, should they
ever dare to take me."
</p>

<p>
"I heard ye, my lord."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, and speak up for an old man, Rob,
whose havers may be misinterpreted, ye ken.
What is it ye will answer, Rob?"
</p>

<p>
"That you called your son, the Master, an
unscrupulous rebel," he replied.
</p>

<p>
Lovat nodded his great head approvingly.
</p>

<p>
"Bonny it sounds.  That'll make the House
o' Peers sit up.  We'll carry it with silver hairs
and injured innocence, Rob&mdash;an auld man, my
lords, near doited with years and sorrow."
</p>

<p>
He paused, and the look of fear twisted his
features once again.
</p>

<p>
"It would look better to bide here," said he,
in a mutter to himself, and so, with a pinch of
snuff, he turned towards the door again.  But
a moment later he was back, and this time
his limbs fairly shook with fear.
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" he gasped, one gout swollen
hand upon his breast.  "I canna wait here
like an auld maimed dog.  There are places
I can bide until arrangements can be made.
Quick, boy&mdash;saddle a horse and let us go."
</p>

<p>
"The horses are all gone, my lord," said Rob.
</p>

<p>
"All gone?  So that is how they treat me.
Then we must walk until we find one.  Surely
my people will help their chief."
</p>

<p>
"There is a pony, your lordship," cried
Rob, and going to the stable he led out the
powerful little beast.
</p>

<p>
Shuffling back to the house, Lovat crept
up the creaking stairway and returned some
minutes later with his strong box.
</p>

<p>
"Fasten it behind the saddle, Rob," he said,
"or better still can I trust ye to carry it?"
</p>

<p>
He stood for a moment glooming at the ground
and then begun to hunt amongst his pockets
for a piece of paper which, when he had found
it, he read most carefully and tittered in a
strange falsetto manner to himself.
</p>

<p>
Then taking a silver whistle from his waistcoat
he blew it three times and took to breathing
upon his frozen fingers.
</p>

<p>
From the heather a hundred yards up the
glen two men had risen at the first note, and
came running towards them&mdash;long-haired,
ragged gillies, Fraser by their tartan.  They
stood a little way from Lovat, watching him
like dogs ready for the trail.  The frost of
their night watch stood upon their bonnets
and their beards were stiff and glistening.
Waving Rob aside Lovat began to speak to
them in a low tone, but before he had said
more than a dozen words his voice rose to a
scream through the influence of some private
passion, and he menaced them in Gaelic so that
they quailed before his clenched fist.  But as
suddenly his voice dropped and he caressed
them, patting their cheeks and then dismissing
them, stood panting beside Rob&mdash;all the fire
gone&mdash;once more just an old sick man.
</p>

<p>
Very slowly he clambered upon the pony, and
so they started and began to pass the cluster
of huts near Gortuleg.  The frightened people
trooped out of their doors to see their chief go
by, and a dozen Frasers armed with muskets
and swords gathered about him and trudged
in silence towards the west.
</p>

<p>
At the corner of the brae Lovat turned and
looked back on Gortuleg.  Beneath his bullying,
tyrannical, shifty character there was a kind
of bedrock of that highly coloured sentiment
that is akin to melodrama.  He played to the
gallery with infinite zest and genuine enjoyment.
It was a nice pose to combat the diminishing
power of the chieftainship&mdash;where force was a
dangerous weapon, sentiment was often a
two-edged sword.
</p>

<p>
"Farewell," he said, in his deep voice and
with honest tears in his eyes, "for maybe I
shall never see you again."
</p>

<p>
It did not matter that the house was not
his, nor an imposing habitation at the best of
times.  All that mattered was that he was at
the turn of the brae, going downward&mdash;an
exiled chief.  Fully conscious that the setting was
saga-like the clansmen set up a piteous lamentation,
and bowing his great head Lovat motioned
them on, and the journey continued.  And in
this fashion after many weary hours they
reached Loch Muilzie in Glenstrathfarar and
for the time being considered themselves in
safety.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Far away, dimly discernible in that wilderness
of heather, two men were running like wolves
on the trail&mdash;two men with dirks by their sides,
and death in their hearts&mdash;running tirelessly.
On the outskirts of the Fraser country they
passed another man who was watching the
pass and without a word he joined them&mdash;three
men running in single file, bending double
in open places&mdash;heading for Knoidart.
</p>

<p>
Long after, when the sun was falling, Muckle
John pulled in his horse for the third time
within an hour and listened intently.  From
the drenched hillside a curlew was crying
amongst the shadows, and from up the hill
came the clamour of a muir-fowl.
</p>

<p>
But no whisper of the danger that lurked
unseen amongst the silences&mdash;awaiting the night.
</p>

<p>
And then with troubled eyes he continued his
way, taking cover where he could, seeking a
place of refuge.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
LOCH ARKAIG
</h3>

<p>
Day followed day with no sign of the
soldiers, and as time passed, Rob wished most
fervently that Muckle John had not disappeared
so abruptly, leaving him in an unknown country
with a helpless old man.
</p>

<p>
One morning there was a movement in Lovat's
hut and the old chief stood peering out of the
doorway looking very savage and uncouth.
He had forgotten to place his wig on his head
and the scattered tags of grey hair were caught
by every gust of wind.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," he said at last, shivering with the
cold, "take a day in the hills and learn where
the English are and whether a French frigate
is off the coast."
</p>

<p>
Only too glad to fall in with such a suggestion
Rob prepared to set off at once.  Suddenly
Lord Lovat called to him.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," he said, "where did you come from
that night?"
</p>

<p>
"I came from Culloden."
</p>

<p>
"Culloden&mdash;and did you meet anyone on
the road?"
</p>

<p>
"Only Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
The Fraser's cold eyes swooped down on him
like a hawk dropping from the clouds.
</p>

<p>
"Muckle John," he repeated, "I seem to
know the name&mdash;so you came with him did ye?
And where were you, Rob, when the horsemen
arrived?  Was Muckle John with you then?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he had left me."
</p>

<p>
"Of course&mdash;of course&mdash;and then he came
back and told you he was going away on
important business, Rob."
</p>

<p>
"He said he would return."
</p>

<p>
At that Lovat left him, laughing as though
something mightily funny had been said.  But
at the door he turned, still convulsed with his
humour, and wagging a finger at him remarked:
</p>

<p>
"Mind my words, laddie, the race is not always
to the swift nor the battle to the strong."
</p>

<p>
But Rob only looked at him in wonder, seeing
nothing but an old sick man overtaken by
dotage.
</p>

<p>
Then setting out upon the heather he made
for the head of Loch Arkaig.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-070"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-070.jpg" alt="HE PEERED THROUGH THE HEATHER UPON THE BEACH.">
<br>
HE PEERED THROUGH THE HEATHER UPON THE BEACH.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the day he saw no glimpse of
red-coats, and when evening was falling he
stepped boldly down upon the shore of the
loch, and thence onward to Lochnanuagh,
where, to his excitement, the white sails of a
frigate were bellied out with the breeze.  Hastily
concealing himself he peered through the
heather upon the beach where a great number
of people, principally Camerons and Macdonalds,
were collected, and with them a squarely built,
consequential little man very plainly dressed,
who seemed greatly agitated about the numbers
on the shore and anxious to disperse the crowd
at all costs.  But the more he cajoled and
threatened the more closely they thronged
the beach, and in the meanwhile the frigate
had run down her anchor and lowered a boat.
In it Rob could distinguish four men and some
cargo, which had been slung down from the
deck.  On the shore there was a sudden silence
almost startling after the clash of voices before.
The creak of the rowlocks came nearer, and
though far up the hill&mdash;so still was the
day&mdash;Rob could catch the French manner of their
speech, and once he heard the small man upon
the beach cough and blow his nose.
</p>

<p>
But immediately the keel of the boat grated
upon the shingle, the greatest animation was
displayed.  The sailors threw the cargo (which
comprised some half-dozen little casks) upon
the sand, and under the instructions of the
little man they were carried into a secluded
place and a rope slipped round them, whereupon
he set about paying the sailors.
</p>

<p>
At that moment, however, there was a sullen
boom like the noise of a gun far out at sea, and
without a second's delay the boat shot away to
the frigate, the anchor was raised, and running
up her canvas she wheeled like a sea-bird and
catching the breeze sped towards open water.
From the noise of firing out at sea it was
apparent that an action was in progress between
an English man-of-war and the French ships.
</p>

<p>
The excitement upon the beach now boiled to
fever heat.  The hills nearest the bay were
soon black with spectators, and in the midst of
this new sensation the casks upon the beach
were forgotten by all except the little man.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, had he not passed so close leading
a Shetland pony very carefully and yet
urging it to its fullest speed, Rob would never
have remembered the landing of that mysterious
cargo and consequently never have been mixed
up in the tragedy of gold.  But to Rob there
was something enormously mystifying about
the character of this solitary traveller, with
his anxious manner, and the rattling casks
ranged high upon the pony's flanks.  It was
like an old wife's tale of the fairies and their
secret kegs of heather ale.
</p>

<p>
Partly because they were going the same
road&mdash;partly because his curiosity was awake&mdash;he
followed him through the heather, keeping
a sharp eye meanwhile, for again and again the
man upon the track would swing suddenly about
and send his gaze ranging the hill-side for fear
of being followed by the people on the shore.
But always he did so with the utmost haste,
urging the pony onwards after each halt, as
though he feared the approach of night, or
something that Rob knew nothing about.
</p>

<p>
And so they reached Loch Arkaig, and on
the shore of the loch the man seemed to hesitate
and take thought, and then hitching the pony to
a tree he conveyed the casks to the sand beside
the edge of the heather, and flinging off his
coat, drew a spade from a hidden place and
commenced to dig.
</p>

<p>
Twilight had come, and so shadowy had the
shore grown that Rob crept nearer, wriggling
through the tufts of heather and rock as
noiselessly as an Indian.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, however, he saw the head and
shoulders of some one else silhouetted against the
grey surface before him, a man who crouched
and ducked his head as the digging ceased or
recommenced upon the beach with the same
care that he himself was practising.  It was
evident to Rob that there was more in all of
this than he had imagined.
</p>

<p>
At last, apparently satisfied, the watcher
began to retreat towards him, running on all
fours up the hill-side.  So rapidly did he come,
indeed, that Rob had no time to roll out of the
way, and with a swift bound the newcomer flung
his full weight upon him, uttering no sound
whatever, and together they rolled over and
over in each other's arms.
</p>

<p>
One moment Rob was uppermost, then the
other, who seemed all arms and legs and sharp
clawing fingers.  Twice Rob felt his throat gripped
and two thumbs upon his windpipe, and each time
he managed to jerk his head away.  Then with
a swift dive of his right arm he reached the knife
in his stocking, and pulling it out he plunged
it into his assailant's shoulder.  It was a small
blade, ill-fitted for dangerous work such as
this; but a thin scream told him that he had
penetrated the man's thick great-coat.  Then
perceiving his opponent jerk his head about
with the pain, Rob clutched a heavy stone and
driving it against his temple sent him senseless
upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
It was a narrow escape, but fortune had
apparently come to his aid in the nick of time.
With a gasp of relief he sprang to his feet, when
out of the darkness a voice said: "Stand, or
I fire!" and the cold barrel of a pistol was
rammed against his cheek.
</p>

<p>
He had forgotten the man upon the shore.
</p>

<p>
"I am unarmed," gasped Rob; "and it is
the man upon the ground whom you should
guard against, not me."
</p>

<p>
At that the pistol was lowered, and seating
himself the newcomer laid it upon his knee and
ordered him to relate his account of the fight,
to which he listened with the closest interest.
Then rising he bound the unconscious man's
arms and legs with some rope which lay upon
the beach, and thrust a rough gag into his
mouth.
</p>

<p>
"And now, my lad," said he, "tell me what
brings you here."
</p>

<p>
With some hesitation Rob related his
experiences of the last two days, and when he had
finished his companion clapped him upon the
back.
</p>

<p>
"Bravely done," he said; "and let me tell
you that Archibald Cameron is proud to meet
ye."  So saying he wrung him warmly by the
hand and sprang to his feet.
</p>

<p>
He was that Dr. Archibald Cameron, brother
to Lochiel, who was to suffer death at the hands
of the Government in the year '53, a very
gallant gentleman and the last to fall in the
Stuart cause.
</p>

<p>
The moon was climbing into the sky as they
stepped towards their prisoner; but Cameron
first took Rob aside and whispered in his ear:
</p>

<p>
"What I buried," said he, speaking in the
Lowland tongue, "would set the Highlands
in a blaze.  It is a merciful Providence you
turned up as you did.  For now we can hide
it all the easier in another place, or maybe
two places.  But give me your oath on the
naked dirk that no word of it will ever pass your
lips except to the Prince."
</p>

<p>
"The Prince?" echoed Rob, who had
followed him with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
"And who else?  Did ye no jump to what
the bonny casks meant?  French gold, boy&mdash;enough
to buy every claymore in the Highlands
and Argyll as well.  Now d'ye see?  Come, Rob."
</p>

<p>
With that, Cameron approached the man upon
the ground and motioned Rob to take his legs
while he grasped him by the arms.  So they
made for a hollow place, and as they laid him
down he groaned and opened his eyes, and at
that moment the moon, clearing the tops of the
trees, played its pale shafts upon the ghastly
face of Ephraim Macaulay, late schoolmaster
in Inverness.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
THE WATCHERS BY NIGHT
</h3>

<p>
Darkness overtook Muckle John to the south
of Loch Garry in the Macdonald country.  He
had travelled without halt all day, keeping to
the less frequented roads, and seeing on every side
traces of the panic that followed Culloden.  In
every village was the same terror and the same
frantic haste&mdash;some burying claymores with
desperate hands so that they remained only
half covered&mdash;others taking to the hills with
their wives and little ones.  Once a party of
two hundred or more passed him on the road
making for the south-west.  They wore the
look of men utterly dispirited, limping in broken
ranks for all the blithe playing of a piper at their
head.
</p>

<p>
Then plunging on through the heather he
put mile after mile between him and Fort
Augustus.
</p>

<p>
It was about three on the same afternoon
that he pulled in his horse very sharply and
swinging about gazed back.  He was not sure
that he had heard anything.  It was more a
premonition than anything else, but a northerner
pays close heed to such things.
</p>

<p>
Everything was very lifeless and dreary on
the road he had come.  There was no sign of
man or beast.  With a grim look in his eyes
Muckle John continued his journey.
</p>

<p>
But about an hour later he swerved behind
a ledge of rock and cantered swiftly up the hill,
keeping behind a huddle of crag for some
hundred yards.  Then turning as rapidly he
watched the back trail.  Several minutes passed
and there was no sign of living thing.  Presently,
however, something moved ever so slightly just
where the last rock towered out of the heather.
A man's head rose and fell again.
</p>

<p>
With a faint smile Muckle John continued
his way.  His horse was very tired&mdash;twice it
had nearly fallen through pure weariness.  That
it could carry him little further he realized at
once.  He did not know how many pursuers
were on his track, but he put them down as
Highland caterans ready to cut a throat for a
purse.  In that case they would wait till he
slept, and rush upon him.  It was, therefore, a
matter of life or death for him to find a place of
refuge before the sun fell.
</p>

<p>
The evening was closing in and he was so tired
that he nodded as he rode.  Nowhere in that
rolling desolate country could he see a house or any
trace of clachan or croft.  And behind him waiting
for darkness were men as crafty and cruel
as Indians and just as patient.  If not to-night
then to-morrow, and he might wander over&mdash;miles
of heather for days on end.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the brain of Muckle John was
working.  The future lay open to him like a
man reading a map.  He must throw them
off the scent or perish.  If not to-night&mdash;to-morrow.
He would never come to grips with
them&mdash;that he knew too well.  It would be in his
heavy sleep in the blackness of a Highland night.
It must not be thought Muckle John was much
concerned at the prospect.  Those were days
when life was not held dearly, and when a
soldier of fortune might be hard put to it several
times in a week.  It was more the indignity
of the business that irritated him.  He was
not accustomed to being stalked like a young
stag.  Most men gave Muckle John a wide berth.
</p>

<p>
Even as he brooded on the matter the grey
horse tripped and fell.  No power on earth
could have kept it on its feet.  It was utterly
done.  With a groan it collapsed upon its knees
and rolled over on its side.  Muckle John had
slipped off as it staggered and now stood above
it studying the next move.  He was above
all anxious to get a glimpse of his pursuers.
Loosening his sword and taking a pistol from his
great-coat pocket, he lay alongside the horse
as though his leg were securely fastened beneath
it in its fall.  It was an old trick, but this
was a country of few horses and worth a trial.
He knew that they would close in on him if
they saw him apparently crippled and at
their mercy.  Slowly the minutes passed and
there was no sound, while a mist rose from the
moist bed of the valley and hung in wreaths
between the hills.  Muckle John lay perfectly
still, his pistol hidden beneath the tail of his
coat, one leg stretched over the horse's flank,
the other doubled up beneath him.
</p>

<p>
Near at hand a stone clinked at the burnside.
It might have been a hill fox creeping away,
but Muckle John knew that a fox does not do
such things.  He felt the eyes of some one upon
him&mdash;but he could see nothing, and all the time
the darkness was falling swiftly and his nerves
were strained to the uttermost, waiting as he
was upon his side for the rush of perhaps a
dozen men.
</p>

<p>
Up the hill he heard an owl call and at that
he smiled, for he knew&mdash;who better&mdash;that it
was not the night for owls to cry Glengarry
way, and that there is a world of difference
between the call of a man and the call of an
owl except to those who have never made it
their business to note such things.
</p>

<p>
It was all falling out as he had expected, and
he waited quite coolly for what was to come,
foreseeing nothing of what really happened.
Indeed it all came about so swiftly and so silently
that few save Muckle John would have lived to
learn another lesson in methods of attack.
</p>

<p>
Now there was an eminence immediately
above him, such a natural frontage of rock as
one sees on many a hill-side&mdash;places naturally
avoided by the wild things unless they travel
up wind or come upon them from above.
Muckle John was looking upward when it
happened.  He was quite aware of the danger
he ran, but he was waiting for a man's head to
show itself against the sky-line just over the
ledge.  Suddenly, without warning but with
only a muffled scraping like small pebbles
scattered wildly, the sky was blotted out
altogether, and at that Muckle John leaped like
a hare and leaped just a thousandth fraction
too late.  The boulder, for that was of course
what had been launched to crush him, killed the
dying horse on the instant.  But it also smashed
the pistol of Muckle John and crumpled his
sword like a thin strip of tin, imprisoning the
tail of his great-coat in the ruin.  It was neck
or nothing now, and wrenching himself free
he gave one glance at his arms and flinging
them down set off through the trees that fringed
the hill-side&mdash;running for his life.  Knowing
that his pursuers were probably tired men he
set the pace in the hope of flinging them off,
keeping the upper part of the hill, seldom
stumbling for all his riding-boots and the
darkness, and sometimes pausing for a breath of
time to hear whether he had cast them off.  But
always at the same distance behind him he
caught the dull padding of feet like wolves on
the trail&mdash;tireless as deer.  He made use of
every feint he knew.  He doubled on his tracks,
he took refuge in places beneath crags.  But
always silently, patiently, utterly undaunted
they came on.  He could not see them but he
heard them moving ever nearer, biding their
time.  There might be six or there might be
twenty&mdash;he could not tell.
</p>

<p>
A desperate plan occurred to him to carry
the war into the enemy's country&mdash;to pick off
single men and throttle them noiselessly in the
heather.  But there was danger in that.  He
was unarmed now, and some one might give the
alarm and they would overcome him in the
struggle.  Stumbling on he looked about him
for a river or a loch in which he could swim
to safety, or some cleft in a rock where he
could hope to meet his assailants single-handed.
</p>

<p>
But there was nothing in all that dreary maze
of darkness, and with anger and despair in his
heart he settled down to a long tireless trot,
waiting to outwit them if he could.
</p>

<p>
It was about two hours later that the moon
filtered thin shafts of grey light through the
scurrying clouds, and in a twinkling the
landscape showed dimly and Muckle John found
himself at a narrow pass running between two hills
with a precipice of rock reaching up hundreds
of feet on either side.  Then the moon
disappeared and he set off at a great pace up the
rocky track, knowing that here, if at all, there
lay a way to safety.  On each side was the
smooth surface of rock.  There was no place
to take refuge, but who could tell what use
might be made of such a place?  He must
have covered half a mile at a quick pace&mdash;all the
quicker because he knew that those upon his
heels, running barefoot, would be handicapped
by the loose stones and jagged edges of
rock&mdash;when he came out upon the open moorland
again and on the breath of the wind he caught
the smell of cattle.  And at once he saw a
way.
</p>

<p>
Again the moon trailed out upon the misty sky
and with eager eyes Muckle John searched the
vapour.  A clump of shaggy dripping coats
huddled in a sheltered place to his right, that
was all, but it satisfied Muckle John, for very
quickly, knowing that there was not a moment
to lose, he drew near to them and running
amongst them, with a great shout brought
them lumbering and snorting wildly to their
feet.  A vast Highland bull bellowed in the
driving mist, but seeing nothing stamped his
feet and shook his horns uncertainly.  Then
unsheathing a small knife, Muckle John drove
the blade into a heifer beside him and sent it
at a gallop towards the pass.  Running hither
and thither, but always avoiding the bull, he
kept them moving, moving, until the head of
the narrow way was reached, and at that he
drew back and halted for the moon.
</p>

<p>
It came again in all serenity, streaming on to
the desolate place with a thin forlorn kind of
light, making the shadow of Muckle John look
very large and the clump of cattle, some fifty of
them and their perplexed and irritated leader,
look like the cattle of a dream.
</p>

<p>
The time was ripe.  With a strange noise in
his throat like the roar of a stag Muckle John
dropped upon his hands and made towards them
on all fours&mdash;a weird enough spectacle on a
lonely moor and very unnerving under a hazed
moon.  It was the last straw to the agitated beasts
packed at the head of the pass.  For a moment
the bull stood his ground, but his heart failed
him, being a bull barely three years old, and
losing his head he set the panic ablaze.  It was
helter-skelter down the gorge and Muckle John
at the back of them with his naked knife in their
flanks.  Again and again his wild cry rose and
fell, faster and faster they thundered on until
nothing could have stopped them&mdash;least of all
three Frasers caught just midway like rats in
a trap.  What happened can never be known
in its grim detail.  But the herd passed on,
and the beat of their feet died down and was
swallowed up in the silent night.
</p>

<p>
And after them Muckle John, scanning the
ground behind them, treading leisurely down
the moonlit pass.  Suddenly he paused and
shivered at what he saw.  Then walking on
he paused again, and once more about fifty
yards away he bent his head, and this time he
took up a flutter of blood-stained tartan and
peered at it very closely.
</p>

<p>
Presently he grinned like a dog.
</p>

<p>
"Fraser," he said, "what brings Frasers so
far from Lovat at such a time&mdash;except to carry
a message at the end of a dirk?  What will
Lovat say when he waits for news of the killing
of Muckle John and he waits in vain?"
</p>

<p>
He stared at the strip of tartan for a long
time, and then setting it on a ledge of rock he
cut it into three equal parts.
</p>

<p>
"I doubt," he said grimly, "but there'll be
a coronach playing when the last of you comes
home."
</p>

<p>
Then making his way to the head of the pass
he lay down underneath the shadow of a rock
and settled himself to sleep.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
BURIED TREASURE
</h3>

<p>
A faint cry of dismay fell from Rob's lips as
he met the evil glare in the schoolmaster's eyes.
Cameron, too, seemed more than a little shaken
at the encounter, though he said nothing, but
appeared plunged in thought about the future.
</p>

<p>
In the hollow place where they stood, it was
impossible for their prisoner to see anything save
the open sky, and a thousand twinkling stars.
</p>

<p>
After a moment Cameron stepped gingerly
beside him, and pulled at his bonds.  Then,
tearing a strip of cloth from off Macaulay's
shirt, he bound it round his eyes as though to
hide their gleaming malice from sight.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Rob," he said, in a whisper, "there's
work for you and me this night.  When we
have ended we will set him free," and he led the
way back to the shore.
</p>

<p>
It was very still and lonesome there with
only the soft wash of the loch and the sighing
of the wind amongst the trees, and Rob wished
the matter well over, and himself back in the
comparative security of Lovat's company.
</p>

<p>
"While I dig them up you roll them along the
right bank," whispered Cameron, warning him
to keep in the depths of the heather, "and
lay them down in the shadow of the burn that
joins the loch yonder.  Should you hear a
sound come back and warn me.  Och!" he
concluded, stepping into the moonlight, "but
these are strange times."  Then bending his back
he sent the spade deep into the sand.
</p>

<p>
"It's fortunate for you that I caught him
watching," whispered Rob, full of pride at his
discovery.
</p>

<p>
"Man," said Cameron, "do I look sic a
gomeral?  I knew he was there from the
moment I hitched the pony to the tree.  Had he
gone it would have fallen out just as I planned."
</p>

<p>
And so began the flight of the treasure&mdash;Rob
creeping through the darkness of the trees,
rolling a cask, stealing noiseless as a shadow
over the wet leaves and bracken, and all the
time seeing in the black night the terrible
eyes of Ephraim Macaulay marking his every
step.  Backwards and forwards until his back
ached, and the moisture stood heavy upon his
brow.  In the passive stillness of the night there
was no breath of danger, no whisper of heather
alive with fugitives, and spies, and nameless
wanderers.
</p>

<p>
As he made for the slope with the last cask
he saw Cameron smoothing over the place
with cunning hands, and patting the marks
of his footsteps about the sand.  Then he too
followed, and together they knelt by the stream.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Rob," said Cameron, "first there'll
be a score of Highland caterans scanning this
shore, and after that there'll be the red-coats,
who are sure to get wind of it; and so it's
our business, ye ken, to mak' siccar* of this.
Maybe ye hae never hidden treasure, Rob, so
let us have a crack about it.  Come ye nearer.
Now, when our friend in the hollow there
gets his freedom he'll show a clear pair o'
heels to those who sent him, an' I'm uncommon
interested to ken just who they are."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Certain.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"No, no," said Rob, with a touch of
importance; "he is after me.  He is a
school-master of Inverness...."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Maybe, maybe," broke in Cameron.
"He is capable of being all that.  But it's
mair than you, Rob&mdash;though I hate to seem
to undervalue your importance, laddie."
</p>

<p>
"Then he is not..."
</p>

<p>
"Whisht!  What does it matter who he is?
So ye understand, Rob.  Follow him, and see
whether he makes north or south, and then
when ye know that I will send you on a journey,
for I am travelling east mysel'."
</p>

<p>
"But Lord Lovat."
</p>

<p>
The man beside him started.
</p>

<p>
"What of him, Rob?" he asked quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe he will require me."
</p>

<p>
Cameron laid his hand on the boy's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," said he very gravely, "Lord Lovat
will require mair than you to save his auld
neck, and for mercy's sake dinna breathe a
word of this night's wark to him&mdash;nor to
onybody but the one ye ken of."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Rob, "to nobody but the Prince."
</p>

<p>
"Come then, for time passes.  When the
search for this treasure commences&mdash;for mark
you a score of eyes must have been watching me
just as closely as your own&mdash;what will they do
when they dig on the sand and find an empty
huddle o' stanes?  They will examine the
neighbourhood for traces of spade work and
footsteps.  They know a single man like mysel'
could not carry those casks mair than a hundred
yards.  They'd come straight here, Rob, like
a pack of hounds on the trail."
</p>

<p>
"What can we do?" asked Rob, fearing his
work was thrown away.
</p>

<p>
"There is just one thing to do, Rob, and
that maybe will sound mighty ludicrous; but
it is always the foolish tricks that are the
hardest to unravel.  When I asked you to show
yoursel' upon the lochside, where it is mair light
than I had looked for, it was because I had a
thought, Rob, and it's just this: there are one
or two gentry in this neighbourhood uncommon
anxious to watch my doings this night, and,
being a modest man, Rob, I'm no overpleased at
the notion," and he brought his head a little
nearer.  "Supposing, Rob," he whispered, "you
were to take my place upon the lochside for a
wee half an hour, or maybe a little over?"
</p>

<p>
"Take your place?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye; put on my wig and coat (the hat I
shall require), and when the moon is hid by
a cloud, just scrunch upon the pebbles, and
sit ye doon so that your kilt is hid.  It would
tak' the eyes o' an owl to see anything amiss
in this dim light, Rob.  Will ye do it, lad?
Would ye?  It is for the Prince, bless him."
</p>

<p>
"Give me your wig and coat," said Rob
for answer.
</p>

<p>
With a sigh of relief and no further word,
Cameron set the wig upon his head, and wrapped
the long great-coat about him, turning up the
collar.  Then they remained in silence gazing
at the cold grey sky.
</p>

<p>
"Quick," said he, at last, "there's a cloud
coming," and he pushed Rob gently from the
gloom of the trees.  At the same time he sang
a line of a song for any who might doubt him,
and fell back out of sight.
</p>

<p>
When the moon swam out of the fleeting
patch of cloud it fell upon the figure of a man
who was sitting on a low piece of rock, with his
elbows on his knees, and his back to the shore,
and in the dead stillness of the night who could
guess how many watched that black, crouching
form, wondering why he never rose or walked
about, but only sat with his chin in his hand,
staring out across the loch.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Cameron passed noiselessly back
to the place where the casks lay.  Forewarned
is forearmed, and he was not foolish enough to
suppose that the hiding of treasure in the
Cameron country would be an easy matter.
</p>

<p>
His clan had much love for him, but they also
had an uncommon respect for gold, and times
were hard.  So a week before the frigate had
flashed into Loch-na-nuagh he had dug a hole
under a rock in the stream which ran into
Loch Arkaig, and inside the hole had hidden a
small barrel for holding half the contents of
the casks (which contained bags of louis d'or).
The other half, for safety, he had resolved to
conceal elsewhere, while the casks, empty of
gold, he had decided to bury in a hasty fashion
just where Rob had placed them.
</p>

<p>
And in this manner the stiff work began, for
only two hours of darkness remained.
</p>

<p>
Happily the wind had risen, and the sound of
his preparations were unheard.  That Cameron
was nervous and anxious to be done one could
have told by his frenzied haste.  First he
walked upstream for fifty yards with a bag
upon his shoulders.  Then he slid a large boulder
across the waterfall to divert the current, and
dropped his burden under the bed of the stream,
where the open barrel was ready to receive them.
Then he returned, never putting foot upon dry
land, and so, with an aching back and bleeding
fingers, he toiled on until at last the barrel was
full and the lid on, and the stone rolled back so
that the water rushed over the spot under
which the treasure lay.
</p>

<p>
The digging of a hole for the casks down the
stream then commenced, and that ready, Cameron
set off towards the mouth of the burn in the
opposite direction from where the first portion
of the gold lay buried; and still wading in the
current, he began to approach the shore.  About
a score of yards from the loch a great rock rose
by the side of the burn, and some six feet above
it a single branch of a tree swayed stiffly in the
night breeze, extending in a straight line from
the trunk, for near the shore the hill-side was
woody and thick with undergrowth.
</p>

<p>
Now the hardest part of the work began.  He
first of all slipped a piece of rope through the
loop of the remaining bags holding the end of
it in his hand.  For a moment he rested, then
leaping upon the rock, he crouched an instant,
and sprang straight for the thick branch above
him.  Grasping it tightly, he swung himself
cross-legged upon it, and leaning over began
to haul the bags up beside him, slinging the rope
securely about the tree.
</p>

<p>
Having detached the first bag, he conveyed
it along the branch, and, smoothing aside the
leaves, there was revealed a hole in the trunk
of the tree about the size of a saucer, into
which he squeezed it.  This he did many times,
until the contents of the second half of the
casks were inside the hollow trunk, and then
rearranging the leaves, he took a bird's nest very
gravely from inside his hat, and laying it over
the hole, slipped a couple of eggs from a little
bag round his neck inside it, and let himself
down again upon the rock.
</p>

<p>
Then burying the casks as he had planned,
and that but carelessly, so that the top of one
of them even stuck a little through the turf, he
threw a few gold pieces upon the ground.  The
work was finished.  Stealing back, he gave a
low call to Rob, who, waiting a moment, slipped
back to his side.
</p>

<p>
Cameron without a word slipped on the great-coat
and his wig again, and patting Rob upon the
shoulder, led him down upon the beach, where
the bright moonlight made the loch gleam like
beaten silver.  The spade he had concealed in
a secret place.
</p>

<p>
"Let us have a crack together for a moment,"
said he in a low voice.  "That we will be seen is
probable, but I think none watched just now.
Ye might wonder why I," he continued, speaking
more loudly, and with his head turned a little
towards the trees, "who have exercised such
care, have trusted you, Rob, who are a stranger
to me.  Then I just canna tell you, for I do not
know, and that's the sober truth.  Anyway here
is a plan o' the places and other things; and
dinna let this out of your hands, Rob, and if
ye are taken, swallow it, or destroy it in some
way.  In case we are watched take it from my
hand as though we were saying good-bye.
Now!" and extending his right hand, Cameron
cried, "Good-bye, Rob," in a very clear voice.
and made to pass the paper; but with a flustered
movement he bungled it, dropping it upon the
ground.
</p>

<p>
"Tuts!" said he, and stooping quickly
made a great business of thrusting it into Rob's
hands.  "Follow that spy to-night," he said,
"and then haste ye on the footsteps of the
Prince, and tell him that I wait his instructions
in Lochaber.  Should ye need me send word
that 'there's a muir-fowl snared.'  Mind the
words, laddie, for I'll ken by that ye are taken."
</p>

<p>
At that moment there was a small noise like
a sigh behind them, and Cameron started and
peered into the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Speak lower," he said, "you understand?"
</p>

<p>
"I do," Rob replied.
</p>

<p>
"Then come.  Let us set the fellow loose, and
after that the less we see of Arkaig the
better."  So saying he led the way to the hollow
place.
</p>

<p>
The moonlight shone smoothly down between
the swaying tree-tops, but it fell upon empty
greensward and bristling heather.  No man lay
there.  Not even his ropes remained.  It was
as though he had been spirited away.  Without
a word, Cameron drew Rob swiftly back.
</p>

<p>
"Separate and run," he whispered in an
agitated voice, "for we must be surrounded,"
and bending his body he darted amongst the
trees towards the open hill-side.  At that Rob
overtaken by a sudden fear of the unknown,
and a great dread of Ephraim Macaulay, took
to his heels, and running in a direction at right
angles to that in which Cameron had gone, he
doubled on his tracks, and dropped down under
a bank of heather.
</p>

<p>
Fortunate it was he had done so, for swift
flying footsteps sounded close above his head,
and two men sped past him into the wood.
Then, crawling on hands and feet, he made for
the head of the loch.  But he had travelled a
bare five hundred yards before the clear soft
note like the sound of a chanter drifted towards
him.  And the bar that it played was the
fantastic, ghostly tune of Muckle John, the same
twisted melody that had so shaken the school-master
in Miss Macpherson's house.
</p>

<p>
Nearer it came, and he lay flat upon the ground
with a fallen tree before him.  Suddenly on to
the moonlit shore stepped a figure he could not
mistake&mdash;the huge shoulders and chest, the
massive head of Muckle John himself.  And as
he played he peered this way and that, as though
he were in search of some one.
</p>

<p>
Rob was about to run forward, then as
quickly he sank lower in the shadow.
Something held him back.
</p>

<p>
Presently Muckle John laid aside the instrument,
and whistled the haunting catch of tune
in the moonlight.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
FLIGHT
</h3>

<p>
Fear of the night, the unknown prowlers in
the heather, the escape of the schoolmaster,
and above all the danger to his paper, held
Rob in a breathless silence.
</p>

<p>
And all the time Muckle John was walking
towards him, whistling softly as he came.
Passing a few yards to the left of the fallen tree
behind which Rob was crouching he halted
suddenly, and then in a leisurely fashion seated
himself on the trunk of it, with the tails of his
coat almost touching Rob's cheek.
</p>

<p>
For long enough he remained with his elbows
upon his knees staring out upon the loch, and
yet Rob never stirred, biding his time.  At last
with a profound sigh Muckle John began to
speak to himself in a low, musing voice, like a
man troubled about something and doubtful
about the course he should take.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Rob," he said, "where has he got to
now?"  Upon which he sighed again and
shook his head.  "I doubt," he murmured,
"that they've taken him&mdash;for he no answered
my bit whistle.  He would have answered had
he heard, for he promised me, and Rob's no
the lad to go back upon his word&mdash;oh no, you'd
never suspect Rob of that," and he paused in a
heart-breaking manner as though emotion had
fairly overcome him.  As for Rob, it was all he
could do not to spring up and catch him by the
hands; but he lay like a stone, utterly miserable,
hating the paper and his wretched suspicions.
</p>

<p>
"Besides," continued Muckle John more
briskly, "I saved the laddie's life, and glad to
do it.  Oh, no, no; dinna tell me that Rob
heard the whistle and ran his neck into the
noose I was calling him from.  Poor Rob,"
said he again, "I doubt but he's laid by the
heels by this time."
</p>

<p>
Then he stirred a little and began to button
his coat.
</p>

<p>
"I must save Rob," said he in a mighty
determined tone, and at that the boy touched him
softly on the coat.
</p>

<p>
"Muckle John," he whispered.
</p>

<p>
The man beside him started violently, and
came near to falling off the log altogether, so
great appeared to be his astonishment.  But
with an effort at recovery he pushed Rob back.
</p>

<p>
"Down," he whispered, in Gaelic, "down
for your life," and he began to stretch himself
as though he had fallen to sleep.  "Rob," he
murmured at last, "I hope ye did na hear my
vapourings."
</p>

<p>
"I fear I did," replied Rob.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, there's no harm where no ill was
spoken.  But I was hurt, ye ken, that you did
not heed my whistle.  Speak low, Rob, for
there's been a man behind yon tuft o' heather
for the last half-hour."
</p>

<p>
"I was feared," said Rob, "Ephraim
Macaulay was loosed and oh&mdash;Muckle John, I..."
</p>

<p>
"No suspected me, surely?" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
"I was feared, ye see, and..."
</p>

<p>
But Muckle John shook his head, and fell into
a soliloquy in Lowland Scots.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Rob, Rob," he said, "this is no pleasant
hearing.  It makes things difficult.  I'm minded
to leave ye, Rob, though I shrink frae doing so,
for the country is fair hotching with spies and
sic' like, and at this present moment, there's
a wheen men with eyes fair glued to this
spot, and all o' them just hungering for the
dawn.  It's a dangerous ploy ye're engaged
upon, Rob, and one beside which Culloden
was as snug as snaring rabbits," and he sighed
again with his eyes up on the loch.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," he broke out suddenly, "it's enough
to mak' me die with shame when I say it, but
it's Macaulay ye think I loosed.  Come then,
Rob, and follow me, and I swear on the naked
dirk I'll show ye Macaulay," and sliding through
the undergrowth, he beckoned back to him.  In
this manner taking advantage of every scrap of
cover, they reached the wood where the mist
was rising before the dawn.
</p>

<p>
At this point Muckle John advanced very
cautiously upon his hands and feet, and
Rob marvelled at so large a man moving as
softly as a cat.  Of a sudden, however, he dropped
upon his stomach and waggled his foot as a
warning.  For men's voices in muttered Gaelic came
from behind a rock immediately to their right.
</p>

<p>
"He cannot have left the shore, Angus,"
said one, "for Neil is watching the brae and
we will close in on him at sunrise.  Besides, he
is only a boy."
</p>

<p>
"There is a great man with him, Donald;
who will he be?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not knowing for sure, Angus, but
belike he has taken to the heather like many
another pretty fellow, though he looked like
one ye know of, whose name I will not be
mentioning.  Whoever he is&mdash;he will not be meddling
with us, Angus."
</p>

<p>
"But where can the Captain have got to&mdash;he
was watching Archie Cameron and then he
disappeared, and Cameron too."
</p>

<p>
With a backward look Muckle John stole
on, and Rob and he passed into the heart of
the wood and up to the hollow place where
Macaulay had disappeared.  There Muckle John
straightened himself, and pushing aside the
bracken at the lower end of the hollow he
beckoned to Rob.
</p>

<p>
"There," he said, "is your prisoner," and
sure enough there lay the bound and silent form
of Ephraim Macaulay.
</p>

<p>
"But how did he get here?" asked Rob.  "He
could not have rolled."
</p>

<p>
"Rob," replied Muckle John, "I will be
franker with you than you have been with me.
I brought him here mysel'."
</p>

<p>
"You?"
</p>

<p>
"And who else?  But let that be.  I have a
notion that we must hurry," and he began to
unloose the ropes about the prisoner's hands.
</p>

<p>
Rob watched him without a word, too
perplexed to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Muckle John," he whispered at last, "could
we no mak' use of his clothes?"
</p>

<p>
"Tuts," he replied, "it's evident ye were
much impressed with Culloden day; but I
would scorn to use an auld trick like that twice
in one week.  There are folk, Rob, would send
the word round that Muckle John was no
what he was," and he turned again to Macaulay
and loosed his feet.  But the gag he left in his
mouth, only removing the bandage from his eyes.
"Now, sir," he went on, addressing Macaulay
in a low voice, "I have here a dirk which does
its work secretly and yet with dispatch.  Ye
take my meaning?  I have also a loaded pistol
in my pocket, and I flatter myself you are
acquainted with my marksmanship.  Before we
start upon our jaunt there are one or two
questions I would ask ye.  Just nod your head
and I'll excuse a civil answer.  I take it that
we are surrounded here?"
</p>

<p>
A violent nod could just be discerned in the
gloom.
</p>

<p>
"Thank ye.  In which quarter are your
people gathered?  Point with your hand."
</p>

<p>
After a momentary hesitation the prisoner
pointed towards the west.
</p>

<p>
"Brawly done, sir, I knew I could trust you
to lie.  So we will gang to the left just to spite
ye.  Now walk between us, and mind, my dirk
is itching for a dig into your ribs.  If we are
challenged say it is only twa o' your friends,
and at the first word o' treachery I'll stick you
like a pig."  With this caution, he drew the
gag out of Macaulay's mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Hark ye, Rob," he went on in a low tone.
"There are a score of men around this place,
and they're after something with which you are
no unacquainted.  Should we win through there
will be no rest for us till we are well out of the
Cameron country&mdash;but I doubt the length and
breadth of the Highlands will hardly be large
enough."
</p>

<p>
All this he said in a very grave voice, and
then taking Macaulay by the arm, he led him towards
the hill-front with Rob upon his other side.
</p>

<p>
The dawn was near at hand and the driving
mist fell cold as ice upon their faces.  Down
below them they could see the cold sheen of
the loch, and hear the wild fowl crying in the
reeds.  After a full quarter of a mile Muckle
John halted.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Rob," said he, "we have reached
their line of watchers.  As we pass up the brae,
we will be scanned by many an unseen eye.
Dinna speak, but nod to me when I address ye,
and tak' the upper side, for you are nane the
waur for a bit heightening," and with that
they left the shelter of the trees.  In the dim,
grey light, the hillside looked very wan and
desolate.  A whaup was crying mournfully over
a lonely pool of hill water.  Like a shadow
a dog-fox, homeward bound, slipped over the
path and was swallowed up amongst the crags.
</p>

<p>
No other sound reached their ears.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly from the heather at their very feet a
man leapt up&mdash;a squat, red-headed fellow with
a naked dirk in his hand.  Something in
Macaulay's dim face seemed to have aroused
his suspicions.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" he cried in Gaelic.
</p>

<p>
"Answer him," growled Muckle John in
Macaulay's ear, but before he could say a word,
the Highlander had scanned Rob's face, and
with a shrill warning scream he leaped backward
into the heather.  It was his last mortal
word.  With a whistle of flying steel Muckle
John whipped his claymore free, and lunging
as it swung from the scabbard, drove the blade
in to the hilt.
</p>

<p>
With a terrible cry the man slithered
backwards and coughed, and Rob turned sick at
the manner in which he writhed in the heather.
Through the mist half a dozen forms came running
in their direction.  There was not a moment
to lose.  Hastily disengaging his sword, Muckle
John flung his great-coat about the head of the
schoolmaster, and hurling him down the hillside
dragged Rob to his knees with a hand upon his
mouth.
</p>

<p>
The clatter of Macaulay's flying form and his
muffled cries drew the newcomers past the place
where they lay, and then springing to his hands
and feet Muckle John made off in the opposite
direction into the heart of the swirling mist.
There was a brief silence and then far away,
came a shrill yell taken up again and again until
every crag seemed alive with voices, and the
faint glow of the rising sun made their escape
seem impossible.
</p>

<p>
"They've found him," cried Muckle John,
mounting the hillside at a great pace with Rob
at his heels, "so it's save your breath and
follow me."
</p>

<p>
There was little cover on that part of the hill,
and it was evident from the frenzied shouts
rising from below, that their pursuers had seen
them crossing an open space.
</p>

<p>
"Quicker, Rob!" cried Muckle John, darting
away like a hare, his head bent below his
shoulders as he ran.
</p>

<p>
At last, when they had reached a mass of
crags and loose stones, he dropped behind the
first, dodging back along the upper part of the
slope, while Rob scrambled behind him.  They
halted for a moment, about five hundred yards
higher than the way they had passed a few
minutes before, and Muckle John peeped round
a boulder and scanned the misty slope beneath.
</p>

<p>
"Look," said he at last.  Far below, by
stretching his head forward, Rob saw many
forms moving like dots amongst the heather.
Foremost of all came Ephraim Macaulay,
waving them on; then, in a rude half-moon,
swept some thirty ragged Highlanders, shock-headed,
bearded, fierce looking caterans, racing
like dogs upon the trail.
</p>

<p>
"Broken men," said Muckle John grimly,
watching them as keenly as a fox watches
the hounds.  "Cameron rogues and nameless
cattle.  Would we were out of this country."
</p>

<p>
The sun was rising over the glen, and even
in that hour of deadly peril Rob must needs
admire the gold light upon the blue loch, and
the fresh greenness of the spring in the trees far
below.
</p>

<p>
Their pursuers had now reached the point
where they had doubled back along the hill,
and here they were put out, searching the rocks,
and spying along the other slope and making
closer search.
</p>

<p>
"It was that last burst did it, Rob," whispered
Muckle John, in a glow at his cleverness; "but
I must admit I'm no liking the position.  They're
anxious to lay hands on ye, Rob, and that's the
truth.  I'm thinking it must be grand information
ye carry, but I'm no the man to question
onybody about what best concerns himsel'."  Shaking
his head he took to watching the movements
of their pursuers again.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could tell you, Muckle John,"
replied Rob unhappily.
</p>

<p>
"Och," said he with a great show of
indifference, "I was only daffing ye.  It's maybe
only because ye were seen wi' Archie Cameron.
He's no good company for folk just now."
</p>

<p>
"He's a brave gentleman, Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, maybe; but there's aye some one to
bring up stories against a man.  Some say he
is faithful to the Prince, but others whose names
I'm not knowing will tell you he has an eye to
his own affairs."
</p>

<p>
Rob listened with a flush of indignation upon
his face.
</p>

<p>
"You do him wrong," he blurted out.  "The
Prince has need to thank him for last night's
work, and I'm bound to carry word of it."
</p>

<p>
He paused abruptly, fearing he had said too
much.  But Muckle John was apparently
intent upon the hillside.
</p>

<p>
"Look," said he, "they're coming straight
for us.  Now, Rob, it will be touch and go, and
do what I tell you without question, for I know
this country like my ain hand; and I tell ye at
once that if we are not twenty mile on the other
side of them before nightfall, we might as well
cut our ain throats.  And, Rob, mind it's you
they're after, no me.  Should you care to hand
anything over for safe keeping, just in case&mdash;ye
ken&mdash;" and he paused, looking over Rob's head.
</p>

<p>
"That I cannot," said Rob firmly.
</p>

<p>
"Then follow me," was all the answer Muckle
John gave, and putting a huge rock between
them and their enemies, they ran swiftly slant-wise
up the slope until they reached the summit,
where for a moment Muckle John looked back.
The great half-moon formation of the ascending
Highlanders was moving quickly upwards.
</p>

<p>
"This is no red-coat work," he gasped, "but
tartan against tartan, and fox hunting fox,"
and away they went along the opposite side of
the hill, just low enough to miss the sky-line.
</p>

<p>
As luck would have it that part of the hill was
very bare and empty of cover, and ere they had
gone half a mile a distant shout warned them
that they were seen, and that the whole force
of their pursuers was now upon their line of flight.
</p>

<p>
Rob saw a sudden tightening of Muckle John's
mouth, and now it ceased to be a game of hide
and seek, but a race for dear life.  The pace was
terrible.  Rob's lungs were bursting with the
straining, so that red flashes of light swam before
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Quicker!" cried Muckle John, "they are
gaining!  Oh, can ye no mak' a sprint,
Rob&mdash;only a hundred yards?"
</p>

<p>
For a while Rob struggled on, stumbling and
gasping, until at last his foot caught in a tuft of
heather, and he fell heavily to the ground.
Without a word or pause, Muckle John, who
was leading by some ten feet, turned swiftly, and
picking him up, continued his wild race for the
broken rocks that lay before them.
</p>

<p>
Two hundred yards behind came the foremost
Highlanders, leaping over the ground in
bounds, their claymores ready in their hands.
A minute, and Muckle John had passed among
the rocks, then doubling right and left, he sped
towards a monstrous boulder, and scrambling
up, pulled Rob on top.  Now on the back of
this boulder lay another great stone poised upon
it, and carrying Rob over his shoulder, he
clambered up and so to a cleft in the side of the
precipice which fronted the hill.
</p>

<p>
Rob had been too blinded by exhaustion to
notice that before them lay what was apparently
a cul-de-sac with bare crag on every side, and
had he done so he would have realized why the
Highlanders had bared their swords.  For they
were to all appearances in a death-trap.
</p>

<p>
But Muckle John, wiping his brow with the
sleeve of his coat, seemed well enough content,
and placing Rob upon the barren cleft, he turned
about and looked down upon the scene below.
His assailants were gathered about the rock
on which he had first sprung, and were debating
what course to take.  Far behind came the
main body, and still farther away, Ephraim
Macaulay.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," said Muckle John, "have you your
wind yet?"
</p>

<p>
The boy groaned in reply, but struggled to
his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said Muckle John, "I am not the
daft fool ye no doubt take me for&mdash;there is a
way up this cliff only known to me and one
other.  You see this cleft?  It runs for fifty
yards in a slanting direction, and there's little
enough foothold.  There is a break at the
corner there and a bit jump of maybe two feet,
but no easy, with just a bare rock and six inches
to land on.  But dinna waver or lose heart, for
there's no return and it's certain death to bide
here.  After that, climb straight up, but leaning
to the left, and when ye reach a small tree-stump
wait for me, for then it becomes no easy matter."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Rob hesitated, but Muckle
John pushed him gently on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"It's death here," said he again, "for they
can go back and reach the top in two hours."
Then in a leisurely manner he drew his claymore
to hold the rock against assault.
</p>

<p>
Knowing that if he hesitated he was lost, Rob
set foot upon the narrow path that ran along the
smooth edge of rock, and never looking down for
fear of turning giddy, he wormed his way upwards,
feeling every foot of the slippery surface.
</p>

<p>
A sudden silence fell upon the onlookers below,
and then a harsh noise of voices reached him,
and a moment later a stone crashed on the rock
within a foot of his head.
</p>

<p>
"Haud tight, Rob," shouted Muckle John;
"dinna mind them!" and whipping out his
pistol he fired, shattering the arm of another
man who was poised for his aim.
</p>

<p>
Had any one of them there carried a musket,
Rob would have been shot like a crow, but as
Muckle John shrewdly guessed, no one of that
ragged crew had more than cold steel, though
that was ready should the boy falter and fall.
</p>

<p>
But creeping onward he reached the place
where the empty space lay, and without a pause
he stepped across, regained his balance and
disappeared round the corner.  At that a great
yell of anger broke out, and a sudden rush was
made for the lowest rock, upon which half a
dozen men climbed and thence swarmed up
within three feet of where Muckle John stood,
awaiting them.
</p>

<p>
At that he swung down upon them, and
laying about him with his claymore, cleared the
stone and stood looking upon the crowd of his
enemies with great good-humour.  Growling
sullen threats, they fell back out of reach of his
deadly sword, and so, setting his back against
the crag, he drew out his whistle and, placing
the hilt of his claymore between his legs, he
broke into a Highland rant.
</p>

<p>
Now the story of that tune was one peculiarly
obnoxious to the men below, for it was written
to commemorate a great clan battle, in which
the people of the West had not covered their
name with glory.  He played it with grim
relish, giving it such a sprightly measure, that
every note seemed a jeer and a bitter gibe at
their kith and kin.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, so engrossed did he grow with his
melody, that he did not notice a man to
his left pick up a great stone, and launch it
like a flash upon him.  Moreover, it was aimed
with a deadly purpose, for it took the claymore
on the blade and sent it spinning over the edge
upon the earth below.
</p>

<p>
With a cry Muckle John leaped for the cleft.
The men below, with a wild shout, swarmed up
like hungry wolves upon the place he had
abandoned.
</p>

<p>
And then drawing his pistol and dirk, he fell
upon his knees like a wild-cat defending its
lair with tooth and claw, and sent the first man
hurtling backwards with a bullet in his brain.
</p>

<p>
"Lochaber pig," he taunted, "it takes a
dirk to make you squeal."
</p>

<p>
"Man without a tartan," they screamed back
in Gaelic, "landless&mdash;nameless one..."
</p>

<p>
"No name is better than a Lochaber name,"
he cried with a laugh, driving them back for
the third time.
</p>

<p>
But his position was desperate, for the long
blades of his assailants could reach him before
he could reload, and his dirk was useless except
at close quarters.
</p>

<p>
Now beside him there was a rugged boulder
of about three feet in diameter, and no sooner
had his eye rested on that, than he bent his
long arms around it, and pushing it to the
edge rolled it over upon the jeering faces
within a few feet of his own, and without
watching the panic that it caused, he sprang
upon the narrow cleft and began to pass along
the road that Rob had gone before.
</p>

<p>
But now things were very different.  Below
him, a dozen men had stones in their
hands&mdash;behind him, those who had the courage were
already mounting the dead-strewn rock to
follow him.
</p>

<p>
There was for all that a mocking twinkle in
Muckle John's eyes, and he whistled a bar of the
tune he had played, and so, walking steadily
onward, reached the empty space.  It was that
critical moment that they had selected for their
volley of stones, and indeed it would have gone
ill with anyone knocked off his balance at such
a time.
</p>

<p>
But this Muckle John realized as much as
they, and out of the corner of his eye he had
gauged their scheme to a nicety.  He made a
step forward, therefore, and a very quick fling
back, which few could do where there was not
room for the feet to stand, ankle to ankle.  And
as the stones rattled upon the face of the rock
instead of his own, he crossed very coolly and
passed on.
</p>

<p>
Foiled in that plan, they took to aiming
at him indiscriminately, and the dull
thud upon his side and legs reached Rob up
above.  Soon a stone cut his face, and he must
needs wipe the blood out of his eyes to see his
way, which delayed him and brought his
pursuers (the few who dared) the nearer.
</p>

<p>
But he crept on, nevertheless, and at last
reached Rob, and supported himself by the
little broken tree.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Rob, Rob," he gasped, "I nearly spoilt
all.  Follow me, for they'll turn the corner in a
minute.  Once let us get back to the top, Rob,
and there's no going back," and he looked down
upon the heads of their pursuers with a meaning
smile.
</p>

<p>
The last five yards were as hazardous as the
rest, and more than once Rob gave himself up
for lost.  But each time Muckle John steadied
him and jested, and whistled a snatch of tune.
</p>

<p>
At last they scrambled upon level ground,
and lay with bleeding fingers and knees and
all the strength gone out of them.
</p>

<p>
Some minutes passed, and from below came
the faint shuffling of footsteps.  With a groan
Rob struggled up and peered over.  A dreadful
sight faced him.  About twenty yards beneath,
where one man was forced to climb upon the
other's shoulders, the foothold had failed, and
after a momentary, fluttering grasp at the thin
grass that grew in patches here and there, a
mournful cry went up, and the two bodies slid
and tumbled and sped out of sight.
</p>

<p>
"They're killed!" cried Rob.
</p>

<p>
Muckle John rose stiffly to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"I said there were but two who knew the
way," he replied, "and one is mysel'," and he
stretched himself and began to walk up the
slope of the hill.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Rob," said he, over his shoulder,
"they'll be after us now, but we have two
hours' start, which, saving the English, should
prove sufficient."
</p>

<p>
Then quite suddenly he stopped in his tracks,
and stared with a frown upon the glen below.
Drawing Rob forward, he pointed downwards,
saying no word.
</p>

<p>
And Rob said nothing either; there was
nothing to say.
</p>

<p>
All along the valley and up into the hills
beyond were scattered tiny white tents, and
little figures in red coats moved hither and
thither like ants in an open space amongst the
heather, while the sun shone and glinted on
white flickers of steel.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
THE TURN OF THE SCALES
</h3>

<p>
"Rob," said Muckle John, "this is a nice
business, for here we are with the wild Cameron
country and Arkaig safely behind us, and within
a few steps of Glengarry's land, for which we
have been struggling for the last four hours and
more."
</p>

<p>
To the south-east of them was Glen-Pean
and Glen-Kingie stretching out in solitude.
But between them and comparative safety lay
the sleeping English tents, and nearing them
at every moment were the Camerons and
Macaulay.  Muckle John shook his head gloomily.
"We canna go back, Rob, and we canna go
forward&mdash;at least no until nightfall, and then
we're like to meet with a bullet."
</p>

<p>
He lay upon the ground, and chewed a piece
of grass, eyeing the English tents with a frown.
</p>

<p>
"We're as good as lost," said Rob hopelessly.
</p>

<p>
"Man Rob," replied Muckle John grimly,
"ye possess a rare discernment."
</p>

<p>
With a sigh Rob let him be, and took to
thinking about his own desperate affairs.  Twice
during the past twelve hours he had been on the
point of destroying the paper and each time
he was thankful that he had waited.  But now
they were as good as lost.  Captured either
by the English or by Macaulay they were doomed
for a quick death, and the dispatch would prove
a great piece of treasure-trove for either&mdash;the
map that would show the way to Prince Charlie's
gold, with which he could buy ten thousand
men to his standard.  At least that was how
Rob looked at it, and some would say there
was some truth in what he believed.
</p>

<p>
It was the thought of the money falling into
such hands that determined him to destroy the
map.  He stole a glance at Muckle John, but
his eyes were fixed steadily on vacancy.  Then
slipping away, he leaned with his back against a
rock, and drew the envelope cautiously from the
side of his brogue, where he had concealed it.
</p>

<p>
It was sealed and addressed to the Prince.
Rob had hardly time to glance at it, however,
before a warning call from Muckle John made
him spring to his feet, the paper still in his
hand.
</p>

<p>
"See, Rob," cried he, but eyeing the piece of
paper keenly, "here comes Macaulay from the
west, so we must decide on the instant.  Once
and for the last time, hae ye onything that I
can tak' charge of, for it's you they'll search,
no me."
</p>

<p>
Rob felt himself weakening, but again his
promise to Cameron withheld him.
</p>

<p>
"No," he cried, and made as though to tear
the paper in two.
</p>

<p>
"You doited fool!" screamed Muckle John,
rushing at his hands.
</p>

<p>
Rob with quick alarm leaped aside, and
the big man tripped and floundered along the
ground.  What was he to do?  But of a
sudden he stood still.  Why should he doubt
Muckle John?
</p>

<p>
"I've taken your advice," he said, and
showed the piece of paper in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"It's only what seems reasonable," replied
Muckle John.  "Now put it by, for it's neck
or nothing for us, Rob."
</p>

<p>
"Have you a plan?" asked the boy, with his
eyes on the white tents and his heart in a sad
state of fright.
</p>

<p>
"A sort of a plan," he replied, and started
at a run rewards the English.
</p>

<p>
Without a word Rob followed him.  There
was no time to question such a course, and
already Macaulay was within a mile of them.
But when he saw them heading for the tents in
the glen below he paused, as well he might,
for the sight of two Jacobite rebels scampering
towards an English camp was sufficiently
arresting.
</p>

<p>
The Highlanders with him, who had no wish
for nearer acquaintance with red-coated soldiery,
slackened their pace too, and, dropping below
the sky-line, became invisible in the heather.
</p>

<p>
On ran Muckle John, and behind him Rob,
until an English sentinel raised his musket and
called to them to halt.  The boy glanced
anxiously at his companion's face.  But he
gathered nothing there.  There was certainly
no sign of fear.
</p>

<p>
"Who goes there?" cried the sentry.
</p>

<p>
Quite quietly Muckle John thrust a hand
into his great-coat pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Here is my passport," he replied, "and
this is my guide.  I am Captain Strange, on
special duty in the west," and he handed over a
document to the man, who read it slowly, and
then saluting, stood at attention until they had
passed.
</p>

<p>
When they were about twenty yards distant,
however, Muckle John spoke in a low voice to
Rob.
</p>

<p>
"Look up the hill," he said, "and tell me
if Macaulay is coming down."
</p>

<p>
But there was no one to be seen, and on
learning that, Muckle John gave a great sigh
as though he were vastly relieved.
</p>

<p>
They neared the tents and were walking on,
when an officer rose to his feet and stopped
them.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" he asked, "and what
kind of Highland wild-cat is that?" pointing
with the end of his sword at Rob.
</p>

<p>
"I am Captain Strange," said Muckle John.
</p>

<p>
"Strange," echoed the man, who seemed
a good-humoured fellow, greatly bored with
sitting among the hills.  "Oh yes, I ken ye
by name, and I am Captain Campbell, at your
service.  Come and have a crack inside," and
he made to enter his tent.
</p>

<p>
With a momentary hesitation Muckle John
followed him, but first of all he took one swift
sweeping glance over his shoulder at the hillside.
</p>

<p>
Then, seating himself within, he fell into
conversation, while Rob waited outside the
tent, watching the soldiers standing at their
posts, or marching up and down amongst
the heather.
</p>

<p>
All the time a curious presentiment of fear
grew heavy upon him, which the silent day
only intensified.
</p>

<p>
"I take it you were at Culloden," said Captain
Campbell; "that must have been a poorlike
affair."
</p>

<p>
"None so poor," said Muckle John; "where
there are starving men and bickering chiefs
you don't look for much resistance, but they
broke two lines, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Did they so?  It is evident the Argyll
men were not in prominence."
</p>

<p>
"No," replied Muckle John drily, "the
Campbells were employed in pulling down
walls."
</p>

<p>
The other eyed him uncertainly.  He felt
the sting under his words.
</p>

<p>
"If the business had been left to the Duke,"
said he, "there would have been no call for
levies from the Low Country."
</p>

<p>
"If it had been left to the Duke," replied
Muckle John, "every clan in the north would
have made havoc of Argyll."
</p>

<p>
"You speak strangely, sir&mdash;I take it you
mean no offence to the Clan Campbell?"
</p>

<p>
"I," echoed Muckle John, "what have I
against them?  I am a Lowlander, as my
name tells ye; we canna all be born across the
Highland line."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, Captain Strange, there are braw
men on both sides; I take it you are on the trail
of the rebel leaders?"
</p>

<p>
"And who else?  But I would as wittingly
trap foxes in Badenoch; they disappear like
peat reek on a summer's night."
</p>

<p>
Captain Campbell nodded his head, and taking
out a dispatch from his pocket, he drew his
stool a shade nearer.
</p>

<p>
"You come at an opportune time," he said,
"for here is a dispatch in which your name
appears, and certain secret information is
contained for transmission to you."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, sir," said Muckle John, all attention.
</p>

<p>
"It has reached the knowledge of the Duke
of Cumberland that certain rebels are concealed
about the shores of Arkaig, and amongst them
Lord Lovat, who has fled in that direction from
Gortuleg House.  Two days after Culloden, a
party of dragoons surrounded the latter place,
but he had gone, carrying his papers with him.
He is an old man, and should not evade capture
long.  The Duke places the utmost importance
on his capture.  If Lovat is taken, he is assured
all further trouble will simmer out.  As long as
Lovat lives he will counsel resistance, and that
may mean months of service in the hills."
</p>

<p>
"Are any others mentioned?"
</p>

<p>
"It is stated that French gold has been
landed at a place near Arkaig, and here is a
warrant to arrest two rebels who have knowledge
of it&mdash;one is a boy, Rob Fraser by name, who is
acquainted with the hiding-place of Lord Lovat,
and the other is&mdash;who do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"Who indeed, sir?  Lochiel&mdash;Cluny...?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, who but Muckle John, the most
dangerous of them all when mischief is afoot."
</p>

<p>
"Muckle John?  But is he not abroad?"
</p>

<p>
"Abroad&mdash;who ever heard of him abroad
when there is a head to crack at home?  They
say he is wanted on a charge in the Low
Countries."
</p>

<p>
"A dangerous fellow," said Muckle John
severely, "and yet there's a kind of quality
about the man&mdash;a bird of passage, Captain
Campbell, and a bonny player on the chanter."
</p>

<p>
"More a gallows-bird than any other.  He'll
whistle a thin enough tune when the Duke has
finished with him.  He lays great stress on his
taking, I can tell ye.  He can spin a yarn,
Captain Strange, that will be worth hearing,
I'll be bound.  He and that boy, Rob Fraser,
are in company, as desperate a pair as ever
skulk in the heather this day."
</p>

<p>
"I take it there is no saying where they lie?"
</p>

<p>
The other winked very slyly at that.
</p>

<p>
"The net is closing," he said, "and once
the boy is caught, there is small chance of the
other going loose."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In the meantime, Rob was outside, and he
wished Muckle John would come.  Before them
was a weary tramp, and already he was tired.
His eyes shut for a moment&mdash;then opened and
shut again.  He took to thinking of his father,
and how it fared with Lord Lovat, and so
thinking he fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
His awakening was rude enough, for before he
could open his eyes his arms were held behind
his back, and he was hoisted roughly to his feet.
The officer, good-humoured no longer, was
facing him, while half a dozen red-coats shut
him off from all chance of escape.
</p>

<p>
And before him stood Ephraim Macaulay.
</p>

<p>
"Which of you is Captain Strange?" cried
Captain Campbell, very red in the face, and
looking back towards his tent as though he
awaited an indignant reply from within.
</p>

<p>
"I am Captain Strange," replied Macaulay
stiffly.
</p>

<p>
"Then where are your papers?"
</p>

<p>
"They were stolen by the man who came with
his boy, who was sleeping outside your tent."
</p>

<p>
"Be careful of your words, sir.  How am I
to know that you are what you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you did not trouble to read the
particulars on the passport?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir&mdash;I admit that I did not."
</p>

<p>
"Then if you had you would have realized that
I am not six foot two or thereabouts, or travel
with a notorious rebel, such as that boy there.
Also that my name is not&mdash;Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
"MUCKLE JOHN!" shouted the officer,
"if what you say is true," he cried, and breaking
off he started running towards the tent and
peered within, then parting the folds, disappeared
altogether.  But an instant later, he was tearing
about the camp like a man gone mad.
</p>

<p>
"He's made off!" he shouted.  "Sound the
bugle there, and search the hills!"  Then
plunging into his tent again, he reappeared with
his hat in his hand.
</p>

<p>
For Muckle John had taken his departure,
leaving behind him only a neat hole in the canvas
of the tent, on the side farthest from the real
Captain Strange, whose reputation as a secret
agent in the English service did not warrant for
his future safety.  For long the soldiers searched,
but no sign of Muckle John was discovered, and
none had seen him go.
</p>

<p>
To Rob, however, this was poor comfort, for
bound hand and foot and guarded by two soldiers
he passed a miserable night, and when morning
came he was set between a file of soldiers, and
the march to Fort Augustus commenced, where
it was rumoured that the Duke of Cumberland
would arrive that day.
</p>

<p>
It was not till mid-day that his hands were
loosed, and then, very cautiously, he searched
for the precious paper, knowing that the time
for its destruction was come.
</p>

<p>
His fingers ran cautiously down the side of his
brogue.  He did so lying on his side, and his legs
tucked up under his kilt.
</p>

<p>
<i>But all in vain, for the paper was gone</i>.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
THE LAST FLICKER
</h3>

<p>
It is an error to suppose that the Jacobites
were ready to surrender all hope of resistance
without a last bid for terms, if not for victory.
Culloden was lost, but a large body of the clans
had not come up in time to engage in the
battle.  An ignominious flight spelt utter ruin
to the chiefs and unquestioned submission to
the Government, whereas a stand in the hills
was eminently suited to Highland warfare.
Cavalry were useless in rough country and
southern soldiers easily outwitted and confused.
</p>

<p>
Had Prince Charles not lost his head in the
debacle of Culloden he might have remained
King of the Highlands if not of Scotland itself.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the strength of the Jacobite
army was also its greatest weakness.  Quick to
mobilize and equipped by centuries of warfare
for the field, they were also unaccustomed to a
prolonged campaign.  The quick fight and the
swift retreat, the raid by night and the tireless
pursuit were their notion of war.  They cared
little enough for the rights or wrongs of a
quarrel so long as they could kill a man or two,
and make home again with a few head of cattle.
</p>

<p>
For this reason the delay and confusion
following hard upon Culloden played havoc with
the Jacobite army.  Once their faces were set
homewards no power on earth could stop the
clans.  They were weary of campaigning on
scanty fare and small pay.  A few short days
and the Children of the Mist were gathered into
their own mountains and the army had melted
into a few scattered remnants waiting for a
leader.  On the shores of Arkaig a few futile
conferences took place, and then followed hard
the inevitable dispersion.
</p>

<p>
Lord Lovat, on whom the chiefs still laid a
certain trust, was carried to Muirlaggan, where
Lochiel, Glenbucket, Murray of Broughton and
others awaited him.
</p>

<p>
They rose as he was carried into their midst,
moved by a kind of reverence for infirm old age.
</p>

<p>
Murray of Broughton shivering with illness,
with flickering agitated eyes, stood tapping
with his fingers upon the rough table.  He
knew Lovat of old, and had suffered at his
hands; Lochiel, pale from his wound, looked
liked a man more heart-broken than anxious.
Of all the Jacobite leaders he was the great
gentleman and one whose life and motives were
of the purest.
</p>

<p>
Lord Lovat was perfectly at his ease.  He
took the head of the table without question,
scrutinizing each face from under his shaggy
brows unconquered as ever.
</p>

<p>
"Well, gentlemen," he said, "I take it ye
have not accepted Culloden day as your <i>coup
de grâce</i>?"
</p>

<p>
Lochiel shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," he said vacantly, "it is our poor
people that we are minded of," at which
Murray nodded, avoiding Lovat's stony stare.
</p>

<p>
"I too, have a clan," said the old man
sombrely, "I have never forgotten that.  There
is also my son."
</p>

<p>
They had in common courtesy to acknowledge
that he was as deeply involved as any.
</p>

<p>
"It is our duty to prevent Cumberland
taking a ruthless vengeance on our people,"
he continued; "rather than leave them to
Hanoverian justice, we should be prepared to
die sword in hand."
</p>

<p>
Murray of Broughton stirred uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"I fear your lordship does not know how
scattered our forces are&mdash;the Prince flying for
his life&mdash;the clans unwilling to mobilize again."
</p>

<p>
Very slowly Lovat raised his face, and stared
Murray down.  Then turning to Lochiel he
said: "Is that not true?" as though the
Prince's secretary had not spoken at all.
</p>

<p>
"I am ready to sacrifice everything if we can
make a stand," replied the chief of the Camerons
simply.
</p>

<p>
"I think your lordship did not catch my meaning,"
broke in Murray in a fluster.
</p>

<p>
"I think," corrected Lovat with composure,
"I caught it finely."
</p>

<p>
"Your lordship's pardon if I seem to take a
liberty," said Roy Stuart, "but what can we do
more than we have done during the last few
months?  We have been promised French aid&mdash;none
has come.  We have looked for French
gold&mdash;there has been little enough of that.  The
English Jacobites have lain like rats in a hole."
</p>

<p>
"And we&mdash;those of us who can run," retorted
Lovat, "are like rats without a hole.  There are
occasions, Mr. Stuart, when even rats can face
the cat&mdash;and rout him too."
</p>

<p>
"The Prince has ordered us to disperse,"
bleated Murray in a flutter of nerves and tepid
anger.
</p>

<p>
"The Prince," barked Lovat, "gave his last
order on Culloden Moor.  We are done with
princes and Irishmen and grand French promises;
we are men with everything to lose and
something to gain.  Maybe your profession,
Mr. Murray, or is it your Lowland blood, has made
you unacquainted with the lengths that despair
may drive a man."
</p>

<p>
"You are pleased to sneer, sir," blurted out
Murray.
</p>

<p>
"I trust," replied Lovat, in a melancholy
undertone, "you may never have a chance to
repay the compliment."
</p>

<p>
"Come, come," broke in Lochiel, "this is
no time for contentions.  If it is decided that
we shall raise the clans we must make speed.
I take it that we are of one mind upon that?"
</p>

<p>
Lovat nodded his head before any could speak.
</p>

<p>
"Could we but raise a few thousand men,"
he said, "and we shall show the Duke what
Highland warfare may mean.  Let us meet again
in ten days' time each with his people.  Send out
the summons, Lochiel.  Let the Prince take
ship to France if he will&mdash;so long as we do not
betray each other" (and here he looked hard at
Murray) "we are as safe as wild-cats in Argyll."
</p>

<p>
There was a loud murmur of approval from
those about him.  Now, as always, Lovat had
carried the day.  He had come, an old sick man,
coughing in his litter, facing a dozen men fairly
eaten up with fear and perplexity.  In one short
hour he had them at his heel.  With a body
as sound as his mind he would have raised
the Highlands himself.
</p>

<p>
Still Murray of Broughton, that creaking
door, must have his word.  It was more his
habit of mind than any real evil in the man.
He was the soul of method, and concise as the
Lord President himself.  Perhaps he suspected
Lovat, as Lovat in all sincerity suspected him.
Perhaps he was influenced by such reason as he
possessed.  It may be that he foresaw what
was ordained, and knew Lovat for what he was.
</p>

<p>
"My lord," he said in his hesitating voice,
"I have little influence here&mdash;I have no people
to consider&mdash;I am not a soldier, only a man of
business who has tried to serve the cause."
</p>

<p>
They waited while Lovat watched him as a
snake watches a rabbit.
</p>

<p>
"Supposing, my lord, that the clans are
persuaded to rise again, what kind of campaign
can you carry on?  Where can you obtain your
supplies, your ammunition, or money to pay
our troops?  Already the coast is patrolled&mdash;the
Highlands surrounded and the roads to the
south cut off&mdash;what kind of mercy will the
isolated places receive&mdash;the very places where you
hope to obtain provisions?  They will so harry
the country, my lord, to starve you out that the
very sight of women and children coming to
you in the direst starvation will make you
regret this step.  It is starvation, and not defeat,
will give you your answer, my lord."
</p>

<p>
"There's truth in what he says," murmured
a man behind Lochiel.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Murray," said Lovat, "I doubt not
you speak with sincerity, but this is a matter
on which we must take our own counsel.  Look
to your own safety, Mr. Murray, and no
gentleman here will say you acted unbecomingly."
</p>

<p>
It had become a contest between these two&mdash;Lovat
forcing the pace to save his neck, and
Murray, knowing what was behind it all,
struggling, who can say why, to dissuade them
from further bloodshed.
</p>

<p>
He moistened his lips and played his last card.
</p>

<p>
"As you will, gentlemen," he said suavely,
"It is for you to decide.  But as a man of
business, since your lordship has discounted
any finer qualities in me, might I suggest
that perhaps a memorandum of this meeting,
a pledge to bind us together, would give
adhesion to such a proposal.  It is only natural,
and in desperate straits where all must live or
fall together, a prudent course to take."
</p>

<p>
Lovat gripped the edge of the table with his
hands.  This was a blow indeed.  His face
changed colour.  He seemed for a moment to
quiver as though he were icy cold, his head
commencing to shake from side to side.
</p>

<p>
"I agree to that entirely," said Lochiel.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," came from Lovat in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
Murray watched him with all the relish of a
weak man scoring a rare triumph.
</p>

<p>
"Did your lordship speak?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I did," said Lovat, rising to his strength
again, "I see nothing but danger and needless
formality in such proceedings.  We are not men
of business, Mr. Murray&mdash;we are Highland
gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
It was a bold throw, but it won the hearts
of many there, who hated Murray and his
fiddling Lowland ways.  Only Lochiel said
nothing, swayed two ways at once, and ready
to faint with the pain of his wound.
</p>

<p>
"I think," broke in Roy Stuart, "we should
defer signing until we meet again."
</p>

<p>
"Bravely spoken," remarked Lovat, "let
us meet with our men in ten days' time.  I
can promise three hundred Frasers, if not more."
</p>

<p>
They all rose at that and conferred together
before parting, each one promising a regiment,
and that word should go through the hills.
</p>

<p>
Only Murray stood alone, and only Murray
saw a man enter with a package and hand it to
Lovat.  He watched the old man open it&mdash;he
noted how he started and frowned.  More than
that, he read the sudden terror in his face.
</p>

<p>
"Bring that man back!" cried the Fraser,
but none heard him (save Murray), and when
he learned at last that the messenger was
nowhere to be found he groaned and a kind of
despair settled upon his face like a mask.
</p>

<p>
But the thing that puzzled Murray was the
nature of the package.  For it held no paper
(that he could see) but only a strip of Fraser
tartan, and that very stained in one corner
like the discoloration of blood.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
A NARROW ESCAPE
</h3>

<p>
Now when Muckle John had heard the voice
of Macaulay&mdash;or, to give him his real name,
Captain Strange&mdash;approaching the tent, he had
moved ever so slightly backward and loosened
his dirk.  The inevitable had happened, and
he had played with fire too long.  And so,
when the officer hurried out to meet the new
arrival, he did a number of things very quickly.
</p>

<p>
But the first was the cutting of the canvas
farthest from the entrance.  Then with a dive
he was through, and with the tent between him
and his enemies.
</p>

<p>
To the right of him, about a hundred yards
distant, was a sentry, standing with his back
turned, looking towards the hill opposite.  On
his left again were a group of red-coats off duty
and playing cards.
</p>

<p>
To cross the open space and reach the slope
unseen would seem impossible, and yet Muckle
John did it, and what is more, took two hours
about it, which in a period of acute danger
might seem leisurely travelling.
</p>

<p>
What his quick eyes fell upon first was a
horse grazing thirty yards away.  But that
he put out of his mind as too hazardous a risk.
About half that distance away, however, a
tussock of hay was lying&mdash;a loosely bound pile
about eight feet long and four broad.
</p>

<p>
When Muckle John saw that he breathed
again, and taking off his hat, he hurled it in the
direction of the hay, then waited patiently.
Fortunately, no one saw it skim into the air
and drop upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
By this time Strange had roused the officer's
indignation and then his alarm.  He did exactly
what any ordinary man would have done in
the circumstances.  He dashed into the tent&mdash;he
saw the tear and peered quickly through
it.  But Muckle John was round the flap and
unseen.  Then, realizing that his late guest had
bolted, he darted through the door of the tent
again, and bawled the order to arms.
</p>

<p>
At that Muckle John moved like lightning.
He did not dash for the tussock of hay; he
knew that such an obvious place of refuge
would attract them first.  He quite softly
re-entered the tent through the slit, and, crawling
under the bedding on the floor, he watched the
scurrying soldiers outside with keen and
calculating eyes.
</p>

<p>
Half a dozen, headed by Campbell, charged
the hay and turned it over and over.  Then
Strange, not satisfied with that, drove his
sword into the midst of it, and poked and jabbed
with extraordinary determination, at which
Muckle John smiled and lay still.  He had
not to wait long, however, for the inevitable
discovery of his hat sent them post-haste towards
the heather and the rough country beyond,
and saved a closer search nearer home, which
was just what Muckle John had feared and
planned to prevent.
</p>

<p>
Away went the soldiers with Strange and
the little red-faced officer, and the camp, saving
the sentries, was clear.
</p>

<p>
So the first onward move commenced.  With
a spring, Muckle John was through the slit, and
darting over the intervening space, he reached
the mangled tussock of hay and crawled beneath
it.  A rope bound it loosely together.  Slipping
between this and the hay, and trusting to luck
that his boots were hid, he began to move in
inches over the ground.
</p>

<p>
By the time the first soldiers passed wearily
and footsore into camp, too hot and tired for
further searching, he had covered twenty
yards.
</p>

<p>
After them came Strange and the officer,
deep in talk.  They tramped past and all was
quiet again.  And then, to his profound dismay,
two soldiers, late-comers from the pursuit,
sank down upon the hay, and prepared to rest
themselves.
</p>

<p>
"Uncommon 'ard this 'ay," said one of them.
</p>

<p>
"That it be, Silas&mdash;but likewise uncommon
soft after 'eather," and one of them yawned
and loosened his jacket.
</p>

<p>
"What wilt do with the youngster, think
ye?" asked one.
</p>

<p>
"Shoot 'im at Fort Augustus," replied the
other.  "Heard Captain say as 'ow we march
there to-morrow.  Seems cruel t'shoot a mere
shaver, Silas."
</p>

<p>
"It's not as if 'e was a Christian, belike, but
only an 'Ighlander," replied Silas.
</p>

<p>
"That be so," answered the other, apparently
reassured.
</p>

<p>
To Muckle John the information was of
interest.  But for the moment he was more
anxious about the future.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, the short afternoon was closing
in, and a cold spring wind came blowing off
the snow-topped hills.  It set the soldiers
shivering and stumbling camp wards.  It also set
Muckle John free and travelling slowly towards
the rough land at the foot of the slope.
</p>

<p>
And then he thrust his head through the hay,
like a tortoise out of its shell, and looked about
him.
</p>

<p>
To his right stood a sentry, apparently dozing,
To his left, another sentry, but marching to and
fro to keep warm.  Very patiently Muckle
John waited for several things to happen.
It was inevitable that darkness would fall soon,
and that meant safety.  It was also very
probable that the increasing cold would send
both sentries tramping up and down, and in that
lay a chance to escape into the heather unseen.
</p>

<p>
But against these two probabilities was the
stern fact that horses need fodder, and that
every minute brought the search for the tussock
of hay nearer.
</p>

<p>
Had Muckle John been the kind of man who,
having exercised a maximum of caution, takes
a minimum of risk through a very proper spirit,
he would have made a run for it, and dodging
the sentries' bullets, trusted to the twilight
to cover his flight.
</p>

<p>
But Muckle John had a certain pride in these
episodes.  He liked to complete a piece of work
like this&mdash;to leave at his own good pleasure;
above all, not to give his enemies the empty
satisfaction of knowing just how he had managed it.
At that moment the sentry who dozed dropped
his musket, and, hastily picking it up, tramped
heavily up and down like his companion.  There
was just a space of five seconds exactly when
both their heads were turned away from him.
</p>

<p>
Five times Muckle John tested it, leaving half
a second for accidents and the half-turns at the
corners.
</p>

<p>
Then drawing himself clear of the hay, he
waited, crouching on his hands and knees.  At
last with a spring, he cleared the danger-spot,
and was flat with the heather when the sentries
turned again.
</p>

<p>
The next five seconds saw him thirty yards
away, the next another forty, and then he fell
to running with bent back&mdash;a shadow among
shadows, until he was gathered into the
darkness and was seen no more.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was on the evening of the next day that
Muckle John, travelling all night and resting
by day, reached Inverness, and, muffling up his
face, trod through the silent town and knocked
at the door of Miss Macpherson.  Inside all
was utterly quiet, and for a moment he feared
that she had gone.
</p>

<p>
But very slowly the door opened, and a pair
of keen eyes looked into his face, while a nose
like an eagle's beak was thrust forward as though
on the point of striking.
</p>

<p>
"Wha's there?" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"Mistress Macpherson," said Muckle John;
"let me in, for I am spent, and this is no the
place to exchange pleasantries..."
</p>

<p>
"Pleasantries indeed," she snorted.
"Nothing was farther frae my mind," but
she let him in for all that, and bolted the door.
</p>

<p>
Then, raising the rush-light, she stared into
his face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she cried, "and I thought so.  Good
evening, Mr. Muckle John, though no sae muckle
in spirit as when last we met."
</p>

<p>
"No, madam&mdash;ye say true," he replied
frowning at the fire-light.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," said she, "before we go farther&mdash;what
of Rob, the obstinate, dour body?"
</p>

<p>
Muckle John shifted his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe he's no been as fortunate as we could
have wished," he said, slowly shaking his head.
</p>

<p>
"Dinna clash words wi' me!" she screamed.
"Oot with it, ye Hieland cateran&mdash;what o'
Rob&mdash;where is he&mdash;is he in prison?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no," cried Muckle John, "though
maybe no so far off, either."
</p>

<p>
The hawk eyes were now fixed fiercely on him.
</p>

<p>
"What did ye come here for?" she cried.
"What has kept your feet hammering the road
for hours past?  Was it just for the pleasure o'
a crack wi' me?  Oh, no, my man, there's a
bonny tale behind your face," and she sat
herself down, her chin resting on her hand.
</p>

<p>
With a shrug Muckle John told of the flight
from Culloden (saying nothing of his part that
day), and of the meeting on the shore of Arkaig,
and the taking of Rob.
</p>

<p>
"He is meddling in business that I canna
control," he said finally, "and so he's bound
for Fort Augustus, and out of it he must come
or my name's no Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
"Which is probably true," sniffed Miss
Macpherson, "and no sae comforting as maybe
ye intended."
</p>

<p>
He gloomed at her a moment without speaking.
</p>

<p>
"Mistress Macpherson," he said at last,
"listen to me.  When Rob is brought up in
Fort Augustus, your friend Ephraim Macaulay,
whose real name is Captain Strange and a
notorious spy, will seek to prove that he was in
arms at Culloden.  They must prove that, to
put the fear of death on him for reasons best
left unsaid.  Who will know Rob better than
yersel', and who will come to the mind of
Strange mair clearly?  Should he be asked to
travel south, be prepared in advance, for it
rests wi' you whether Rob goes free or not."
</p>

<p>
"I always suspected yon Macaulay," remarked
Miss Macpherson, "and his Scots was
no what I call sound Edinburgh."
</p>

<p>
"He has muckle strings to his bow, and
who can say what arrow may bring doon Rob?
But when the message comes, Mistress
Macpherson, dinna deny that ye ken Rob, for that
will prove his guilt at once, for ithers can be
found who will jump at the chance o' pleasing
Strange.  Mak' a lot of him, and when ye say
good-bye to him in his cell, hand the man on
guard a piece of siller, and shut the door.
There is one I ken in the fort will be glad to do
me a favour, and he will put Rob in one of the
rooms overlooking the outer court."
</p>

<p>
"Go on, my man," said she; "I'm no
slow in the uptak."
</p>

<p>
With a reddened face, Muckle John unloosened
his jacket.
</p>

<p>
"Here," said he, "are one or two things
that may serve our purpose," and he showed
her a coil of slender rope, a file, a pistol, and a
skian-dhu.
</p>

<p>
"They're a bonny lot," said she, "but I'm
no just catching their connexion wi' mysel'."
</p>

<p>
"Mistress Macpherson," said Muckle John,
growing still redder in the face, "if ye could
see your way to coiling this rope about your
waist and concealing the other things, I think
Rob is as good as safe."
</p>

<p>
For long she sat silent.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," she said, "I believe you are an honest
man, though I was positive ye were a rogue
until this very minute."
</p>

<p>
The face of Muckle John was, for once, a
medley of expressions, with that of irritation
uppermost.
</p>

<p>
"I hope so," he replied shortly, "but I'm no
perfect, ye ken."
</p>

<p>
"Why do ye want Rob out so much?  He is
no kin o' yours?"
</p>

<p>
He uttered an exclamation of impatience.
</p>

<p>
"What matter," he cried irritably.  "Should
I save his neck, is not that enough?  Maybe I
have an affection for the boy.  Maybe it is
because we are fellow-sufferers in the Cause."
</p>

<p>
"And maybe," broke in Miss Macpherson,
"it is none of these good reasons at all."
</p>

<p>
To which he answered nothing, but seemed
on the point of bursting into a violent rage, and
then he fell back on silence, as though he were
bitterly offended.
</p>

<p>
"Mistress Macpherson," he said stiffly, "one
thing I can swear to, and that is that I mean
Rob no ill; and this I promise you: that if you
do as I ask, I will answer for his ultimate
escape and safety," and, whipping out his
bared dirk, he prepared to take the oath.
</p>

<p>
"Whisht," said Miss Macpherson, "dinna
behave like a play-actor; I'll do what you want,
and gladly, for his mither's sake, puir woman.
But ye said there is an outer courtyard.  How
will Rob manage to get over that?"
</p>

<p>
"He will not need to do so," said Muckle
John, and rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
Footsteps suddenly sounded on the street
without.  A loud knock came at the door&mdash;then
another, and the noise of a horse's impatient
hoofs thumped and clattered on the
cobbles.
</p>

<p>
Like a vast shadow, Muckle John passed
silently inside the other room, while Miss
Macpherson drew back the bolts.
</p>

<p>
In the street was a trooper, holding a package
in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"For Mistress Macpherson," said he, "from
Captain Strange, now stationed at Fort Augustus,"
and, mounting again, he walked slowly
up the street.
</p>

<p>
Inside, she tore open the paper.  It requested
her to travel to Fort Augustus at dawn.
</p>

<p>
Muckle John read what it was at a glance.
</p>

<p>
Then, gathering up his coat, he bowed, and,
meeting her eyes for a moment, passed into
the darkness of the street and was gone.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
IN THE HANDS OF THE DUKE
</h3>

<p>
To Rob the world had suddenly fallen very
hopeless and forlorn.  By no conspiracy of Fate
could matters have worked out more to his
undoing.  The precious paper entrusted to him by
Dr. Cameron, full of he knew not what vital
news and directions regarding the hidden
treasure, had been stolen, but worse still by an
unknown hand.  It is comforting in a dreary way
to know who has played the thief.  But Rob
had not even that poor satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
He had been taken asleep, and between that
time and the journey to Fort Augustus the paper
had mysteriously vanished.  A horrible thought
presented itself.  Was it taken from him before
he was bound by the soldiers?  Muckle John
had disappeared without a word or an effort to
save him.  He had half-heartedly hoped for a
rescue on the road, but no sign of living soul
had met his eyes.
</p>

<p>
And at last, at sunset, they had reached the
Fort, and he was conducted to a guard-room
and there left to his own thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the door opened softly and the
angular form of Captain Strange slid into the
room.  Rob started to his feet and waited in
silence for him to speak.
</p>

<p>
But that Strange seemed in no hurry to do.
Instead, he took to walking slowly up and down
the room with his hands coiled behind his back
and his chin sunk upon his chest.
</p>

<p>
Then, "Rob," said he, "what did I tell ye
in Inverness?"
</p>

<p>
To which he received no reply.  Rob had
the rare gift of silence.
</p>

<p>
"Did I no tell ye that a gibbet was like enough
to watch your capers before very long?  Maybe
ye've no seen a man hanged by the neck, Rob.
It's no a bonny sight, say what you will; and
in my way of thinking, no a pleasant prospect
for onybody, least of all for a lad of spirit like
yersel', Rob, for I'll no deny I admire your
pluck," and he breathed heavily and stared
out of the window.
</p>

<p>
"Did you come to talk about hanging?"
asked Rob, struggling to speak with composure.
</p>

<p>
"In passing, Rob&mdash;merely in passing.  It is
a subject that fascinates me, I'll no deny.  Come
here a minute; ye can see the hanging-tree
against the sky-line.  It's a rare poseetion,
Rob&mdash;there'll be nane will pass this way but
will ask 'Who's dangling there?' and they'll
learn it was Rob Fraser, executed for meddling
with what didna concern him.  It's a braw
fool ye'll look, then, Rob&mdash;no great rebel dying
for his principles, but just a silly laddie who ran
a big risk for other people's dirty profit."
</p>

<p>
"You can call it what you will," cried Rob,
stung to anger, and paused.
</p>

<p>
"Say your say, Rob; dinna be afraid,"
encouraged Strange softly.
</p>

<p>
Rob shut his lips seeing there was a trap
being laid for him.
</p>

<p>
Perceiving that he would not speak, the other
frowned a moment, then with an appearance
of kindly sympathy he patted him upon the
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Forget my foolish havers," he said.  "I
was only warning you for your ain good, for
it's a dangerous game you're playing, Rob, and
a game that you are playing in the dark.  Will
ye hear me out and say if what I'm telling ye is
no true," and he drew a stool near to the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Let me run over your movements for the
last week or so," he went on.  "After Culloden&mdash;and
ye mind I did my best to save ye that night
in Inverness&mdash;you came to Lovat's country,
and thence down to Arkaig.  There you met
Cameron and buried the gold.  There also you
escaped out of our hands, and I'll grant no so
clumsily, though you were not to blame for that.
Then, accompanied by the desperate man ye
ken as Muckle John, you made to the north and
were captured yesterday in Captain Campbell's
camp.  Now, Rob, is that no the truth?"
</p>

<p>
"It is," said Rob, "though what you have
to say against Muckle John should be kept for
his own ear.  It is wasted on mine."
</p>

<p>
"Brawly said, Rob, but what do ye ken o'
this Muckle John?  However, that can keep.
I'd wager ye'd turn white did ye ken who
Muckle John really is.  But when you left
Cameron you had a paper, Rob.  Supposing that
paper fell into our hands, Rob, or those of the
Duke, what would happen, think ye?  There
would be no gold for your Prince, and from the
information in the letter&mdash;supposing there
should be any, which I am assured there
is&mdash;there would be such a clearing of Jacobites,
including the Pretender, as would end their
cause for ever.  That is, I repeat, supposing
such a paper fell into the hands of the Duke.
But there are those, Rob, who are Scotch after
all, and no verra partial to such measures.
There are mony, Rob, who do nane so badly oot
of your Jacobite friends, and it's poor shooting
where there's no game," and he smiled very
knowingly, baring his teeth like a fox.
</p>

<p>
Rob was puzzled by the note of suggestion
in his speech.  Had Strange the map or not?
If not, had Muckle John taken it?  If Strange
had it what was to be gained by such words?
Would he not take it to the Duke at once?
</p>

<p>
He glanced quickly at the man facing him.
In his eyes he read avarice, cruelty, and
cunning.
</p>

<p>
"If I hand you the paper," said Rob, "what
do you propose to do?  Would you give it to
the Duke?"
</p>

<p>
Strange checked a smile.
</p>

<p>
"That depends," said he, "for between
ourselves, where the eagle feeds there's poor
pickings for the other birds.  The truth is,
Rob, there are some things you could tell me,
and in return I'd do a deal more for you, for I
am no an ungenerous man, and it's a dreary
prospect, the gibbet."
</p>

<p>
"It is all that," rejoined Rob, "but I cannot
promise until I hear what you want to know."
</p>

<p>
"That's mair reasonable, Rob&mdash;I knew ye
were not the foolish ninny that they took ye for.
Now listen, Rob; if you will disclose the
hiding-place of Lovat and Archibald Cameron, and
help us to lay Muckle John by the heels&mdash;in
return I will see that you are free this very night,
and mair, I will no forget ye when the treasure
is come to light o' day."
</p>

<p>
Rob turned sick at the words, but to learn
more he simulated interest and nodded his head
doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"But the Prince," said he.
</p>

<p>
"In return for Lovat I will spare the Prince."
</p>

<p>
"You?"
</p>

<p>
"Who else, for if you consent none but I will
ever see the document and its particulars."
</p>

<p>
"And you will keep the gold?"
</p>

<p>
Strange winked at that.
</p>

<p>
"We two, Rob," said he with a smile.
</p>

<p>
Then Rob, knowing all and realizing that
Muckle John must have the dispatch, rose to his
feet.
</p>

<p>
"Whether I have been a scapegoat or not,"
he said, "I have only myself to blame; and
let me tell you at once, Captain Strange or
Macaulay, or whatever your dirty name may be,
that nothing can save me from the hangman's
noose; neither you with all your promises nor
anything else, for I have not the paper you
want," and he waited for the storm to burst.
</p>

<p>
But the smile never died from the other's lips.
</p>

<p>
"Weel I know that, Rob," said he, "for I
have it safe here," and he drew the package,
still sealed, from his coat pocket.
</p>

<p>
With a cry of rage Rob rushed at him, but
the chains about his legs tripped him up, and
Strange, stepping aside with a snarl, took him by
the shoulder and flung him violently to the other
end of the room.
</p>

<p>
"Down!" he cried, "or I will pistol you."  In
a grim silence he thrust the package back into
his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Ye see, I hold the cards," he said in a
malignant voice.  "And now is it to be a
dislocated neck and your dead body the prey of
corbies&mdash;or the salvation of your Prince, a share
in the gold, and the taking of Lovat, which is
inevitable in any case, and that of Cameron,
which is only a question of time?  Neither will
suffer the extreme penalty, for Lovat is an old
man who has sat at home, and Cameron is a
doctor and was no at Culloden at all.  As for
Muckle John, I will tell ye why he made such a
lot o' ye."
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" cried Rob.
</p>

<p>
"Whisht!  Dinna take on so.  Once a blind
fool and never again, surely.  But did ye think
Muckle John risked his life just for love o' ye,
Rob?  Heaven preserve us&mdash;he was after..."
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Rob, "but say no more.
I'll tell the Duke you have the paper and throw
myself on his mercy."
</p>

<p>
Strange uttered a shrill cackle of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Tell the Duke, Rob!  Oh, that's fine
hearing.  Mercy!  It's little mercy ye'll get
frae him.  No, no!  I'll hand it him myself,
thank ye.  Perhaps ye thought I was like your
Muckle John, and playing for my ain hand.
You're uncommon green, Rob, but Jerry Strange
is no taken so doucely.  Jerry is honest as the day,
Rob&mdash;so come along and see me hand it into the
Duke's royal fingers.  It'll mak' gran' hearing,
Rob, and there'll be sair confusion amongst the
rebels now," and flinging open the door he drew
his prisoner with him into the passage.
</p>

<p>
Into a lofty room they went&mdash;the chains
clanking about Rob's legs very dismally.
</p>

<p>
A short, red-faced, stout young man of about
twenty-five was sitting at a table reading
dispatches.  He was dressed in a red coat, with
stars upon his breast and much gold cord.  He
wore a white peruke, and had a choleric,
somewhat peevish countenance and a hard blue eye.
There was nothing romantic or attractive in
his commonplace features or sturdy, clumsy
figure.  His countenance displayed neither
humour nor kindliness, and certainly not
beauty&mdash;but only determination, courage, and
common sense in abundance.  It would have
been difficult, indeed, to have laid hands on a
young man so different in every way from his
rival Charles Edward.  It almost seemed that
Justice had given him victory to compensate
him for the odium of his personality.
</p>

<p>
"Vell, Strange," said he, speaking with a
thick German accent, "what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Your Highness," replied Strange, "I have
here a notorious rebel, though young as ye see.
But he was carrying a package which Archibald
Cameron handed to him on the shores of Arkaig
to deliver to the Pretender.  I have reasons for
believing, your Highness, that it contains not
only a plan of where the treasure be hid, but also
the place of concealment of the Prince and the
movements of the Jacobites still at liberty.  We
have followed him according to our instructions."
</p>

<p>
The Duke of Cumberland stared at Rob, then
leapt to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Goot, Strange," said he, smacking his
lips audibly, "you are a vonder.  You vill
not be forgotten, my man," and he ripped open
the seal and unwrapped the paper.
</p>

<p>
Rob could see that there was more paper than
he had thought.  But what made his heart
bound with sudden hope was the bewildered
expression upon the Duke's face.
</p>

<p>
"Is zis a joke, Strange?" he shouted, at
last, flinging a sheaf of papers upon the floor.
"Those," said he in a white heat of fury, "are
accounts of charges for drugs.  And zis," he
added in a roar of anger, holding a scrap with
the tips of his fingers, "has ze impertinence
to say 'this is no ze goose that laid ze golden
egg.'"
</p>

<p>
In the utter silence Rob laughed until the tears
ran down his cheeks.  And all the time Cumberland
glared at Strange, and the latter stood with
an utterly vacant expression, as though he had
opened his mouth to say something and then
clean forgotten what it was.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the Duke turned with a scream of
fury upon Rob.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow," he cried, his face livid with
passion, "ve vill see 'ow you laugh on the
gibbet," and he stormed on Strange to go,
turning his back upon them both.
</p>

<p>
But Rob did not move.
</p>

<p>
"On what charge am I condemned?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The Duke switched round.
</p>

<p>
"Charge!" he cried, and then paused.
"Strange, what is the charge?" he asked,
stamping his foot.
</p>

<p>
"It was for carrying treasonable matter,"
replied Strange in a husky voice; "but I
suppose..."
</p>

<p>
"There was nothing against the throne in
the package," broke in Rob.
</p>

<p>
"Strange," shouted the Duke, "am I to
wrangle with a school boy?  Is 'e not a
rebel?"
</p>

<p>
"He is, your Highness.  He was in arms at
Culloden."
</p>

<p>
"Zen surely that is enough to 'ang any man."
</p>

<p>
"You have no witnesses," retorted Rob.
</p>

<p>
"Zen find vitnesses.  Himmel!&mdash;make vitnesses!"
broke out the Duke, seating himself
again at the table.  "But go, Strange, before
I burst&mdash;and 'old&mdash;come back in half an hour.
I would talk with you over this and other
matters."
</p>

<p>
In his cell Rob could have wept for joy had
he been given to that sort of thing.  For he
realized that though he had been the goose who
had drawn off the pursuit from Cameron, the
Prince was safe, and that the gold would yet be
his.
</p>

<p>
In this elation of feeling he crossed slowly to
the window.  The last rays of the sun were
falling upon the blank bars of the gibbet, at
which he felt his heart sink, for it was a cold
and melancholy ending to his ambitions and
his life.
</p>

A quarter of an hour later a trooper clattered
out of the courtyard of Fort Augustus, bound
for Inverness and Miss Macpherson; and in
due course Captain Strange knocked upon the
door of the Duke's room and entered.  In the
intervening hour the latter had dined, and
appeared somewhat mollified in temper.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, there were those who said the Duke
of Cumberland was genial enough at heart, and
though a hard man, one with a sense of justice
and honour.  He has had few kindly words and
many harsh ones, and there is a saying that
there is good in every man.  As a German
prince he had no sympathy with the Jacobites.
To him they were savage rebels speaking a
barbarous language and wearing a barbarous
dress, about whom he knew nothing except
the misrepresentations that were current in
England.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Strange, Strange," he laughed, wiping
his eyes with the back of his hand, "who is ze
goose now, and where are ze golden eggs?"
</p>

<p>
"Your Highness," said Strange flushing, "it is
humiliating, I'll allow, but I must tell you that
I was mair than unfortunate, being bound hand
and foot by Cameron and no knowing just what
had taken place.  Cameron made good his
escape, for my men were of his ain clan and
not anxious to bring dishonour on their name
if another would do as well.  That he foresaw,
I'll be bound, and so he sent this boy at a run
with a package, and the presence o' Muckle
John lent him additional importance."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, vell," said the Duke, "but ve must
bring the boy to his senses, Strange.  Produce
your vitnesses, and he'll show us things, I'll be
bound.  Vot does he know, Strange?  Can he
tell us any ting?"
</p>

<p>
"He knows where Lovat is hid, your Highness,
and ye ken what his capture will mean.
It will show the rebels we have long arms."
</p>

<p>
"True&mdash;but vill he tell, Strange?"
</p>

<p>
"A week or two by himsel' will work wonders,
your Highness, once he knows we can hang
him."
</p>

<p>
"And Muckle John?"
</p>

<p>
Strange bit his lip.
</p>

<p>
"Would I could have taken him," he said
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Your chance vill come, Strange.  Ze net
is closing.  Soon ve vill 'ave ze Pretender, and
zen all ze smaller fry vill be caught too&mdash;"
he yawned and pushed back his chair&mdash;"I am
sick to death of zis country," he said; "it is
always rain, rain, rain, and nosings to eat or
drink."
</p>

<p>
And so Strange left him looking gloomily
out of the window upon the black Highland hills.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
MISS MACPHERSON COMES TO FORT AUGUSTUS
</h3>

<p>
Dawn found Rob watching at the window.
Into the night his eyes had stared until the cold
wind before the grey light of day fell upon his
face.  Vast forms moved dimly into sight.
Hills stood up gradually against the ashen sky.
Trees formed in vague, black columns, with
their trunks half hidden in mist.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a faint, pink glow flushed the pearly
grey with colour, and in an instant the valley
grew distinct.  The sun rose and sent the dew
glistening like a thousand twinkling diamonds,
then, passing higher, flooded the Fort with
yellow light, and threw the black shadow of the
gallows-tree upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
With a sigh, Rob turned and seated himself
upon his bed, waiting for the end.
</p>

<p>
But hours passed and no one came.  He
heard the sharp words of command from the
drilling-square below, and the grounding of arms
as the soldiers stood at attention.  Outside, a
man whistled cheerfully, and that reminded him
of Muckle John.  Surely he would not desert
him!  Did he not pride himself on always
finding a way?  Rob remembered, with a wry
smile, that the only way he had found two days
before had been for himself.  He took to
wondering what Cameron would say when he
heard (if he should ever hear, which was not
so likely) how ill his joke had treated his
messenger.  He took a doleful satisfaction in
imagining him greatly disturbed at having
sent him to his death.
</p>

<p>
At that moment footsteps sounded along
the corridor, and the key of the door was
turned.
</p>

<p>
Into the room stepped Captain Strange.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Rob," he said with a grin, "you're like
a ghost.  No used your bed?  Come, come, I
thought better of you than that.  Not afraid,
are you, Rob?"
</p>

<p>
"If I were afraid I would do what you want,
but you will never have that satisfaction."
</p>

<p>
"Never is a strong word, Rob.  I would not
use that word to the Duke, boy..."
</p>

<p>
"He can hang me, but it will be without a
fair trial."
</p>

<p>
Strange leaned his arm upon the window ledge.
</p>

<p>
"Wrong again; there will be a fair trial,
Rob," he said without turning his head, "and
that this very day.  It is more than many
another has had&mdash;and that's the truth."
</p>

<p>
"What can you prove against me?"
</p>

<p>
"I have a witness, Rob, who will tell us all
about you.  What do you say to that?"
</p>

<p>
"That you lie."
</p>

<p>
Strange switched about, and his face hardened.
</p>

<p>
"Come then," he cried angrily, and led the
way from the room.
</p>

<p>
With a sudden foreboding of danger Rob rose,
and the door clanged behind him.  If, in a
single night, they had found a witness his doom
was complete.  And yet, what witness could
they have discovered?
</p>

<p>
Down to the great place where they had gone
the preceding night Strange took him.  Outside
the door stood two soldiers with muskets.
Passing between them, the heavy door shut silently
behind.  Facing Rob sat the Duke of Cumberland,
alone.
</p>

<p>
Hastily he looked round the room.  No other
person, witness or otherwise, was to be seen.
</p>

<p>
"Prisoner," rasped out the Duke, "are you
villing to give us informations regarding certain
rebels?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not," said Rob.
</p>

<p>
"Zen vot prevents us from hanging you?"
</p>

<p>
"On what charge?"
</p>

<p>
"As a rebel."
</p>

<p>
"You know nothing against me," said Rob,
gaining courage.
</p>

<p>
"But we 'ave a vitness who does," said the Duke.
</p>

<p>
Then rising, he opened a little door that lay
behind his chair, and stood to one side to let
some one pass into the room.
</p>

<p>
And very slowly, her head in the air, came
Miss Macpherson.  Rob felt his heart give a
great thump, and then he grew cold as ice,
for he knew, whether she wished to harm
him or no, that his aunt was bound to recognize
him.
</p>

<p>
Strange advanced to meet her.
</p>

<p>
"Mistress Macpherson," he said, "you remember me?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye," she replied drily, "I know ye fine,
though we met last in more reputable circumstances."
</p>

<p>
"Alas!" he smiled, "duty is a hard master."
</p>

<p>
The Duke burst in at that.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," he cried, "ees zis boy known to
you or nod?"
</p>

<p>
"Your Highness," she replied, looking Rob
squarely in the eyes, "this is my wretched
nephew."
</p>

<p>
With a bitter look of mortification and fury,
Rob turned his back on them.
</p>

<p>
"Vas 'e in arms against ze throne?" asked
the Duke.
</p>

<p>
"He was all that," she replied grimly, and
Strange rubbed his hands with joy.  This was
beyond all expectation.
</p>

<p>
"But, madam," went on the Duke, "you
know vot zis means."  He was evidently puzzled
by her equanimity.
</p>

<p>
"Thrawn necks are too common at present to
be overlooked," she replied drily.
</p>

<p>
He nodded, understanding her dimly.
</p>

<p>
"Zen dere is noding more to be said," he
remarked, and said something in Strange's ear,
who touching Rob upon the shoulder led him
away to his cell, where he was left to his own
dismal thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Returning, Strange begged Miss Macpherson
to be seated, and again whispered into the
Duke's ear, who nodded from time to time, and
smiled sleepily.
</p>

<p>
"As you vill, Strange," he said, and rising,
withdrew.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Miss Macpherson," began Strange
when they were alone, "I knew I could rely
upon you to put even the claims of relationship
aside, when it was a question of loyalty."
</p>

<p>
"Go on, my man," said she impatiently;
"I'm no here to listen to patriotic sentiments."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  Now this is how the matter
stands.  Rob is convicted as a rebel, and there's
only one solution to that.  We agreed from the
start that he was fated for a quick finish.  But
he's young, Miss Macpherson, and your own
blood."
</p>

<p>
"No blood of mine," she said sharply.
"What my poor sister did is no affair of mine."
</p>

<p>
"At any rate, it would not look well for you
to have led to the lad's death."
</p>

<p>
Miss Macpherson's lips tightened, but she said
nothing.
</p>

<p>
"And there are ways and means.  All this fuss
over a boy is not according to reason, much less
the Duke's usual procedure.  But Rob knows
some things that his Highness is ready to hear
in exchange for his life.  More than that, he will
deal generously with him."
</p>

<p>
"What things?" asked Miss Macpherson, shortly.
</p>

<p>
"Where Lovat hides, for instance.  And, mark
you, it will make no difference in the end.  In
a fortnight's time we shall drive the upper end of
Loch Arkaig, where we hear he is concealed.
But we are not sure, and a word from Rob would
help us.  That is hardly treachery, Miss
Macpherson, is it?"
</p>

<p>
"I never had a legal head," she replied, with
an utterly expressionless countenance.
</p>

<p>
Strange rose, and walked twice up and down
the room.
</p>

<p>
"Persuade Rob to act reasonably," he went on,
"and you will have his ultimate gratitude, and,
what is more, that of the Duke as well.  Will
you help us?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll see Rob," she replied.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you..."
</p>

<p>
"But only on two conditions."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?"
</p>

<p>
"That I see him alone, and that he has a fair
week to think it over."
</p>

<p>
Strange hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Your first condition is, of course, simple,"
he replied, "but the second is more difficult."  And
he hurried from the room.
</p>

<p>
In a minute or two he returned,
</p>

<p>
"The Duke agrees," he said; "and now,
please, follow me."
</p>

<p>
They passed through the corridor up the stairs.
Then, opening the door of Rob's cell, Strange
bowed her in, and, closing it, turned the key.
Rob was lying face downwards upon the bed;
he never lifted his head as she entered, and so
she paused and listened at the keyhole until the
footsteps had died away.
</p>

<p>
Then, "Rob," she called, and fell upon her
knees by the bedside.
</p>

<p>
He raised his face and looked at her with
sullen anger.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want with me?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
But for answer she placed her finger on her
lips, and drew a file and pistol from her pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Hide them," she whispered.  When he
had done so, in a dream, and turned his head,
a coil of rope was lying on the ground, and his
aunt was rebuttoning her coat.
</p>

<p>
"Tak' it, Rob," she said.  "Wake up, lad."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly hope sprang to his eyes.  With a
leap he was off the bed, and the rope was below
the hay upon which he lay.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, aunt," he said, "I did not understand."
</p>

<p>
"Tuts," she replied.  "Now, hark ye, Rob,
for there's muckle to grasp.  Yon Muckle John
came to me last night, and sent me here with
the things ye have.  He also sent this letter,"
and she fumbled for a moment in her pocket,
and handed over a slip of paper to him.
</p>

<p>
"Read it by-and-by," she said, "but first
listen here.  They will no hang ye for a week&mdash;that's
sure as death, and it's yon old Lovat that
they are after.  They will search upper Loch
Arkaig in a fortnight, but they would do it sooner
were they to ken just what you know.  Belike,
Rob, if ye told them ye would win free, and in
the meantime the word could reach Lovat to
seek another place."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Rob, "that I could not do.
Suppose he were too ill to escape, or the
message strayed?"
</p>

<p>
"Then, Rob, there is Muckle John, and he
has a way, he says, though I canna believe in it
mysel'.  But the letter from him will show you."
</p>

<p>
Rob drew the paper out, and read it in silence.
It ran:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"DEAR ROB,&mdash;When ye hear a whustle such
as ye ken, do as I say.  File through the bars
of your window and your chains should you
have any and lower yoursel down into the
outer yard where a cart with hay will be lying.
When dawn breaks the cart will move out but it
will not be searched for reasons that I will not
say.  Should ye have anything to entrust to me
in case of accident give it to Mistress
Macpherson, who is our good friend."&mdash;M.J.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was the last sentence that sent the blood
into Rob's cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know why Muckle John is so anxious
regarding my safety?" he asked his aunt.
</p>

<p>
"No," she replied with a troubled frown,
"though I asked him."
</p>

<p>
"Did he reply?"
</p>

<p>
"Not he, but he was sair put about."
</p>

<p>
Rob went over to the window, and laid his
head upon his arm.  A deep despondency had
suddenly fallen upon him.  That Muckle John
was only interested in the suppositious plan of
the treasure seemed only too apparent.  It was
to obtain this that he schemed and planned.
His own safety and life were trifles in comparison.
Enemies within and enemies without, and all
fashed about a plan that did not exist.
</p>

<p>
A sudden determination came to him.
</p>

<p>
Taking a pencil from his pocket, he took up
Muckle John's letter, tore off the part which
contained the reference to the treasure and
wrote upon the back:
</p>

<p>
"This to tell you that what you seek has fallen
into the hands of the Duke."
</p>

<p>
Then folding it up, he handed it to his aunt.
</p>

<p>
"Give that to Muckle John," he said.
</p>

<p>
Miss Macpherson scrutinized his face closely.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," she asked, "ye will do what the
letter tells ye?  This is no enviable position
for any Highland woman, Rob, and I took for
granted that no false pride would prevent you
from making good your escape."
</p>

<p>
"I have not refused," he replied.
</p>

<p>
A look of relief sprang into her face.
</p>

<p>
"Then good-bye," she said with unusual warmth.
</p>

<p>
For a moment they stood hand in hand, and
then she knocked upon the locked door, and
waited for Strange to come.
</p>

<p>
When it fell back, she passed from sight
without a backward glance.
</p>

<p>
For long Rob paced up and down the room.
</p>

<p>
But of a sudden he stopped, and, uttering a
sharp cry, rushed half-way to the door.  For
long he shouted, banging with his fists upon
the wood.  It was too late.
</p>

<p>
That Lovat would be discovered had suddenly
forced itself upon him, and that he would be
regarded as his betrayer would naturally follow.
For now, through his own foolish pride, he had
thrown away the only chance of saving the old
man, by rejecting the help of Muckle John.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
MUCKLE JOHN SHOWS HIS HAND
</h3>

<p>
Miss Macpherson, saying good-bye to Captain
Strange, and acquainting him of Rob's present
obstinacy, but bidding him not to despair, took
her way through the porter's gates, and turned
her horse's head towards the north.  After travelling
in a leisurely manner for some six miles, she
drew in her beast, and dismounting led him into
a small coppice upon the hill-side.
</p>

<p>
All around her lay the lifeless stretches of
heather and grey crag.  Near her side gurgled
a little stream passing through the trees and
down the vacant, wine-red moor.  Behind her
the stark, open slope of brae, around her the
huddle of lonely hills, and no sound at all.
</p>

<p>
The softest noise, like the rustle of an autumn
leaf, made her turn her head.  Within a few feet
of her, regarding her keenly, stood Muckle John.
Where he had come from, and how he had come,
she did not attempt to guess.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said he, "and how's Mistress Macpherson
the day?"
</p>

<p>
"Finely."
</p>

<p>
"And the little business?"
</p>

<p>
"Is completed."
</p>

<p>
"Good!" he said, and smiled with great
good humour.
</p>

<p>
"I handed Rob your letter."
</p>

<p>
"And did he tak' my meaning?"
</p>

<p>
"He said I was to thank ye, and give ye this
bit o' paper, which he tore from your message."
</p>

<p>
His mouth tightened suddenly.  A slight
frown wrinkled his brow, and his eyes flickered
quickly upon her, and then to the paper in her
hand.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, as though a nameless fear had
gripped him, he glowered at her, and snatched
the thing out of her fingers.  Then, turning his
back, he read it at a glance, and, flinging it upon
the ground, burst into a torrent of Gaelic, his
face a deep scarlet with fury.  His unruffled
composure was gone.  In its place was the
blazing Highland temper.  Words poured from
his lips, his eyes flashed with impotent rage, his
whole body trembled with passion.
</p>

<p>
"Are you ill, sir?" cried Miss Macpherson,
fearing he had gone mad.
</p>

<p>
But he only snarled at her.  Then, swinging
about, he began to stride backwards and
forwards between the trees, muttering in low
tones, his hands clenched, and his chin upon his
chest.  After a dozen turns in this fashion he
seemed to recollect her presence and, halting a
little below her, he raised his gleaming eyes to
hers.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," he said, in a trembling, harsh tone,
"I would give all I possess that you and your
precious nephew had never seen the light of day.
Oh&mdash;it is too much!"  He broke off, kicking
savagely at a tuft of grass.
</p>

<p>
"But, sir..." she broke in, for once considerably
alarmed.
</p>

<p>
"Don't sir me!" raved Muckle John, snapping
her up.  "But go, and let me never see your
face again!"
</p>

<p>
"But Rob?"
</p>

<p>
"The sly ninny!  The whey-faced, ungrateful
gowk!  Let him go hang for his ain dourness!
A pretty fool he has made o' me, madam;
and no man nor boy either shall live to fling that
in my teeth."
</p>

<p>
With the strength of a sudden terror she
caught him by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"What sort of talk is this?" she cried.
"Have I no done my share, and sent Rob half-way
to his death in order that you may snatch
him back?  Oh, I said you were no honest man!"
</p>

<p>
"Honest?" he snapped, with a bitter laugh.
"Oh, you're right enough there.  Heaven
preserve me frae being called 'honest,' I'm no
shopkeeper, madam."
</p>

<p>
"Ye were anxious enough about Rob's safety
last night."
</p>

<p>
Muckle John ceased from glowering at the
glen beneath them.
</p>

<p>
"The boy's safety go hang," he retorted.
"Did ye think I cared two bawbees for that?"
</p>

<p>
"It has occurred to me that you promised,"
returned Miss Macpherson.
</p>

<p>
"Promised!  What are promises between you and me?"
</p>

<p>
"Then Rob is to be left to his fate?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
Muckle John turned, and threw back his
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"You have yet to learn," he said stiffly,
"that the oath of a Highland gentleman can
never be broken.  I swore on the dirk I would
bring him safe from prison, and that I will do."
</p>

<p>
Once more he seemed on the point of falling
into another fit of fury; but fought it down, and
pointed instead to her horse.
</p>

<p>
"Go!" he cried.  "And not a word of this
or I'll string you up to your ain roof-tree, and
no' so sorry to have the excuse."
</p>

<p>
"Mercy me!" murmured Miss Macpherson,
and made for her beast.
</p>

<p>
Then, mounting, she sent him through the
heather towards the track.
</p>

<p>
A hundred yards down the hill-side she looked
back.  But the little cluster of trees was empty
of life.  Muckle John had vanished as though
he had never been.  With a sudden fear clutching
at her heart, she dug her heels into the horse's
ribs, and broke into a disjointed canter.
</p>

<p>
On the same morning that saw Miss Macpherson
urging her mount towards Inverness,
in a cave upon a wild and desolate mountain-top
three men were seated playing a hand of
cards.  They were all in the Highland dress,
and armed to the teeth&mdash;lean, swarthy men,
burned by the sun to a deep black-red&mdash;sitting
silent as statues, eyes intent upon the game.
Beside one of them lay a handful of gold coins.
Near the mouth of the cave, lying on his
stomach, was a boy of about fifteen, watching
the hill-side.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he uttered a low word in Gaelic, and
instantly but in the same grave silence the men
ended their play, and gathering up the cards
one slipped them into his sporran.
</p>

<p>
A moment later the mouth of the cave
darkened and the huge form of Muckle John
filled the entrance.  He nodded to each of them
as they saluted him, and motioning them to be
seated he lay for a long time gnawing his lip
and staring gloomily upon the ground.  They
appeared not unused to such behaviour for they
drew together at the farthest corner and the man
with the cards in his sporran took them out again
and, dealing them round, the game went on as
before.  An hour passed and Muckle John had
said no word&mdash;had made no sign.  Of a sudden,
however, a slow smile began to creep into his eyes
and soften the corners of his mouth.  A droll
expression flitted across his face and vanished.
</p>

<p>
Then, taking a piece of clean paper from his
pocket, and a pencil, he studied Rob's writing
in a deep pause, and began to write in a close
imitation, as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"This to tell you that the treasure is discovered,
and that unless it be put in a safe place,
all will be lost.  The bearer of this letter can
be trusted.  Come to me at a place that this
man will show you, for the Prince is with me,
and is in need of you and some gold.  ROB
FRASER."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
This he addressed to Dr. Archibald Cameron
in the Braes of Lochaber, and turning towards
the crouching circle in the corner, he called one
of them, Donald Grant by name, to him, and
instructed him for some time in a very earnest
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Donald," he said, "and let there be
no bungling, for I am not minded to be
soft-spoken if aught goes wrong.  In Lochaber there
lies a gentleman by name Archibald Cameron&mdash;a
brother to Lochiel.  He is skulking with Murray
of Broughton.  I heard so much two days since.
Hand him this paper and keep a slow tongue, but
if he presses you say you were sent by a laddie&mdash;a
reddish, blue-eyed Fraser boy, and that maybe
he minds the words&mdash;'there's a muirfowl
snared.'  Bring him with you and keep him
under close guard until I come back.  But
before you do that, give this second strip of
tartan to John Murray of Broughton, and bid
him hand it to Lord Lovat as a warning from
one he kens well."
</p>

<p>
With these words he dismissed the man, who
slid through the entrance and set out at a slow
indefatigable trot for the south.
</p>

<p>
In the same active, masterful manner he
summoned the remainder of the party and
addressed them rapidly in Gaelic.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said he at last, "is all clear?  Evan
Grant, who is in the stables of Fort Augustus,
will see that the cart is ready.  When the
confusion is at its height he will put in the horse.
You, Donald Chisholm, will lead the horses
below the rampart during the night and mind
they do not whinny at the dawn.  There I will
join you at cock-crow and a boy with me that will
serve our purpose.  He is like enough to another I
ken of to hoodwink a pack of red-coats.  Should
aught go wrong make for the hills, and turn the
beasts loose.  Should they be deceived as I
know they will, lead them into bog-land and
scatter.  You understand?"
</p>

<p>
They all nodded their heads.
</p>

<p>
"This day week then, for I have other work
till then.  Now go&mdash;but leave the lad there to
watch the glen."
</p>

<p>
Silently they crawled out of the cave-mouth,
and were lost among the neighbouring rocks.
</p>

<p>
Then, wrapping himself in his great-coat,
Muckle John took the reed from his pocket
and began to play a Skye song that the oarsmen
sing for keeping time.  But soon he tired of that
and played an old Highland lament that is as
full of sorrow as the hollow of the hills with
snow.  He played it in a heart-breaking fashion
with an eye upon the boy in the cave-mouth, who
was a Macpherson and easily moved.  And when
he saw the tears coursing down his brown cheeks
he could not but gulp too, partly through
sympathy but most of all because of his own
grand playing.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was now the month of May, and still Rob
lay in his cell.  During the past ten days every
source of refined torture had been applied to
break down his silence.  Starved, beaten,
threatened, he maintained a stony front, until
Strange in despair had left him to himself for two
whole days.  It was on the morning of the
third day that he returned, and Rob saw by
the elation in his eyes that something had
happened.  He could only guess that it meant
another disaster to the hunted Jacobites.
</p>

<p>
"Up, you dog!" he cried; "and hear the
news.  What has your silence earned you, do
you think?  It has made you a traitor, Master
Rob Fraser&mdash;a name that your clan will revile
for all time.  Ho, ho, ho!  Think of that
now&mdash;there's fame for ye!  I'd give twenty guineas
to hear what Lovat says when he learns that he
was betrayed by..."
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" cried Rob, "why should he believe
such a lie?"
</p>

<p>
"Because we shall have to break it to him.
Otherwise he might guess who is really telling
secrets, Rob, and that would spoil all."
</p>

<p>
With a mournful groan, the boy covered his
face with his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you not kill me now?" he asked in
a hopeless voice.
</p>

<p>
"Kill you?" echoed Strange.  "Man alive,
there'd be poor sense in that!  It is just because
we will not hang ye that people will know just
why.  No, no, Rob.  You'll live like a fighting-cock,
whether ye like it or no."
</p>

<p>
"It will take more than you to find Lord
Lovat," broke out Rob.
</p>

<p>
Strange shook his head gleefully.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I whisper where he lies hid?" he
said.  "There's an island at the foot of Arkaig,
called Moror&mdash;am I no right?" and he shook
with silent laughter.
</p>

<p>
At that the floor beneath Rob's feet seemed
to dance up and down, and a great despair made
him deaf to all that Strange said&mdash;deaf to the
shutting of the door&mdash;to the brooding silence
that settled once again upon his solitude.
</p>

<p>
When he opened his eyes the sun was sinking,
and he was alone.  The bitterness of the
situation stunned him utterly.  How could anyone
deny that he had turned informer, especially
when the report went round that it was to save
his life.  He thought he had valued his neck;
but now he knew there were things infinitely
worse than death.  What would he not give now
to have lured on Muckle John, and so won his
freedom by pretending he had the plan?
</p>

<p>
And as he brooded deeply, out of the twilight,
like a bird's note dropping into silence, came
the soft music of a chanter.  With a cry he
started to his feet and listened.
</p>

<p>
Again it reached him&mdash;a thin bar of wistful
melody, the sign of Muckle John.
</p>

<p>
Snatching up his bonnet he waved it out of the
narrow window, and at that the whistle sounded
for the last time far away, and died on the wind.
Muckle John was ready.  Hastily Rob took
out the file and pistol, and laid them upon the
floor.  There was little chance that anyone
would visit him again that night.  He had eight
hours before him to file through the bars of his
cell, and conceal himself, just before the dawn,
upon the cart of hay below.  His chains he had
already filed nearly through, concealing the
marks with mud scraped off the damp floor of
his cell.
</p>

<p>
But in case of a surprise visit he left his chains
on, and set upon the rusty bars of the window,
scraping and rasping until his fingers began to
peel and bleed, and his arms ached with
weariness.  At midnight one bar was filed through
and laid inside the cell.  Weak and dizzy with
want of food and exercise, he was forced to rest
for half an hour, and then, crawling back, he
attacked the cross-bar; and two hours later
he had cut it away, and the main part of the
work was done.  It took him only a few minutes
to work himself loose of his chains.
</p>

<p>
Then, uncoiling the rope, he tied one end to
the fragment of iron bar left in the window
casement, and unwinding it softly he let it
run down the rough, grey wall.
</p>

<p>
All was very quiet and dark.  No sound
reached him from below.  Far away, on the
outer guard, he caught the dull tramp of the
sentry, marching to and fro in the wintry
darkness.
</p>

<p>
The time was ripe.  Slipping his pistol about
his waist, Rob wormed his way, legs first,
through the open window, and coiling his feet
about the rope, he took a grip of it with his
hands and began to slide slowly downwards.
</p>

<p>
Down, down he went; past rooms where all
was dark, skinning his knees upon the sharp
edges of stone, bumping and swaying, but nearing
ground at every yard, and with the breath
of sweet night air upon his cheek.
</p>

<p>
And so at last, without misadventure, he
reached the inner courtyard, and looked about
for the cart of hay.
</p>

<p>
The dawn was not far distant now, and he
crept about the place feeling his way, seeing
but dimly, and fearful that there was no cart at
all.
</p>

<p>
At last, however, some ten yards away, his
hand touched a wheel.  With a gasp of relief
he ran his fingers through soft wisps of hay
over his head.  Then climbing up, he wormed
his way beneath a bundle of horse-cloths, and
waited for the morning.
</p>

<p>
The cart had apparently unloaded and was
ready to leave the fort.  Fortunately for Rob
the cloths were heavy, and the horses' nose-bags
and other articles made sufficient to entirely
conceal his presence.  But how Muckle John
could hope to avert suspicion falling on such an
obvious place of concealment, he could not
imagine.
</p>

<p>
Very gradually the grey, flickering lights of
another day glimmered above the fort, and still
there was no sound of alarm&mdash;no sign of Muckle
John.
</p>

<p>
Now the side of the fort where Rob's cell lay
was not much frequented until broad daylight,
the sentry rarely coming so far along&mdash;an item
with which Muckle John was well acquainted.
Opposite this part the hill sloped upwards
towards broken country, commanding a clear
view from the walls.
</p>

<p>
It was not until seven o'clock, for the morning
was dark and cold, that a man passing through
the inner courtyard to water the horses saw the
rope dangling down the wall, and with a frenzied
shout brought the sentry at a run towards him.
</p>

<p>
"Prisoner escaped!" yelled the fellow.
</p>

<p>
With an answering cry the sentry raced
away.  A moment later a bugle sounded the
call to arms.  Clatter of muskets, hoarse voices,
commands, questions, running footsteps&mdash;all the
characteristic commotion of a sudden alarm&mdash;reached
Rob in his hiding-place, and set him
wondering whether Muckle John had failed him,
or whether he had dreamed he heard the reed.
</p>

<p>
For his position was precarious.  He had
escaped for the time; but he was like a rat in a
trap&mdash;able neither to go backwards nor forwards.
</p>

<p>
The voice of Strange interrupted his anxious
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"Guard the gates!" he ordered.  "Come
with me, you men, and search the cell."  Up the
stairs they stamped and their footsteps died
away.
</p>

<p>
Rob imagined them tearing up the stone steps
to his cell.  He could almost see Strange peering
through the window with its filed bars.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he heard him shout from far above
him as though his head were thrust out of
the window:
</p>

<p>
"There he is!  There he is!"  It sent a
shiver through his limbs.
</p>

<p>
But no one approached the cart.
</p>

<p>
Instead, the excitement grew even more
intense, and the courtyard about the cart became
thronged with hurrying soldiers.  On the outer
walls he heard muskets firing, and cries of
"There they go!" as though they aimed at men
upon the hill.  It was all very baffling and
mysterious.
</p>

<p>
Was Muckle John attempting a rescue by
force of arms?  Rob lay very still, and then
his perplexity was set at ease, for he heard a
voice he knew well call from a window some
twenty feet above him:
</p>

<p>
"Vot is it, Strange?" and Strange, despite
his hurry replied:
</p>

<p>
"The prisoner, Rob Fraser, your Highness, is
riding away up the hill with another man."
</p>

<p>
"Then after 'im, Strange!" roared the Duke.
"Ten pounds to the man who catches 'im.
Open the gates; I vill take 'orse myself!"
</p>

<p>
With a rattle the gates rolled back.  The
soldiers galloped through, Strange at their
head.  A few moments later and troopers were
spurring up the hill-side&mdash;the whole fort was
deserted for such a steeplechase.  Ten pounds
seemed within the grasp of many that day.
</p>

<p>
The last trooper had hardly dashed away
before a man came quickly across the courtyard
leading a heavy horse.  With swift hands he
hitched it to the wagon, and, swinging himself
up on the side with his feet upon Rob, he started
towards the gates.
</p>

<p>
A solitary soldier challenged him with a
broad grin.
</p>

<p>
"No rebels in that cart?" he said, peeping
over the top.
</p>

<p>
The man in the cart laughed heartily.
</p>

<p>
"He was more than a match for you," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"That 'e was," agreed the soldier.  "But 'ow
anyone can get out of this fort beats me.
Somebody will look foolish over this."
</p>

<p>
"Be glad it is not you," returned the man in
the cart.
</p>

<p>
"Me?" cried the other, for they were now
twenty yards down the road.  "There'd be few
rebels lost if I had a word in it."
</p>

<p>
"I can see that," shouted back the man in the
cart.
</p>

<p>
And so they passed along the moorside,
and out of sight of the fort.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later they encountered the
soldiers returning.
</p>

<p>
"Not got him?" asked the man in the cart.
</p>

<p>
A sergeant stopped while the rest of them
trudged on.
</p>

<p>
"No; they left their horses and took to the
crags."
</p>

<p>
"Where are the dragoons?"
</p>

<p>
"Led into a bog, and still there."
</p>

<p>
Then, shaking his head, the soldier marched
after his company.
</p>

<p>
Long after Rob threw back the rugs, and
sitting up blinked in the sunlight.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Rob," said the man in the cart, but
with little warmth of manner.
</p>

<p>
It was Muckle John!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
"A MUIRFOWL SNARED"
</h3>

<p>
Now the man that Muckle John had sent speeding
from the cave-mouth to the south reached
northern Lochaber, and halting in a place under
a rock, waited for the dawn.
</p>

<p>
Very slowly the wintry night began to grow
more grey.  A cold wind fluttered the beard of
the watcher under the rock.  From the bleak
hill-side a dog-fox barked, and with the passing
of night a stag moved like a shadow up the brae
and stood for a moment gazing backward,
silhouetted against the skyline.
</p>

<p>
And still the man waited, watching the track
below him.  It must have been about seven
o'clock, and the sun barely risen, when down
the glen came two men walking very rapidly
and saying no word to one another.  Foremost
came a short, strongly built man with a round,
genial countenance and shrewd blue eyes.
About four paces behind again there limped
and tottered a broken cadaverous figure, heavily
cloaked and yet coughing dismally in the bleak
Highland air, and leaning his weight upon a
stick.
</p>

<p>
All the way down the glen they never exchanged
a word; but once the man who led the
way halted, and drawing a flask from his pocket
handed it to his companion, who tilted it up and
then broke into a worse fit of coughing than before.
</p>

<p>
The messenger of Muckle John snug under
the crag took them in with one long, penetrating
glance, but no expression of surprise or triumph
or relief crossed his face.  He regarded them,
as he had regarded the stag, with cold,
inscrutable eyes.
</p>

<p>
Through the hanging mists they came, and
when they had drawn level with his place of
concealment he uttered a forlorn cry&mdash;such
as the whaup sends falling over an empty moor.
Instantly the little man who walked in front
stopped in his stride, and sent his eyes sweeping
the skyline above his head.  But no whaup
was there.  Then turning he said a word to his
companion, who only shook his head wearily,
as though all the whaups in Scotland might have
cried themselves hoarse for all he cared.
</p>

<p>
Presently the man under the rock whistled
very softly.
</p>

<p>
"I hear ye, sir," said the short fellow, speaking
in Gaelic but never raising his head; "and
who might ye be there, like a fox in his earth?"
</p>

<p>
"It is Archibald Cameron I want," replied
the messenger of Muckle John.
</p>

<p>
At that the tall, cadaverous man seemed to
bestir himself, and began to speak in a low
anxious tone to his companion, who cut him
short, however, with scant courtesy.
</p>

<p>
"What is it you want?" he cried, turning
his head towards the hill.  "I am Archibald
Cameron, and now your name, sir, and your
business?"
</p>

<p>
"Will ye come up, Dr. Cameron?  You
will find me beneath the round rock ten paces
from the burn."
</p>

<p>
"Come," said Cameron to the man with him;
"there's maybe news of the Prince."
</p>

<p>
"No news," sighed the other, "is better
than bad news."
</p>

<p>
Then taking to the hill-side they reached the
hidden place and crept within.
</p>

<p>
It was a hole of about six feet by eight and
three feet high, and with the sickly smell of a
fox's lair.
</p>

<p>
"A couthy bit corner," said Cameron to his
companion, dropping into broad Scots.  "What
wad we do, Broughton, had we no siclike places
as this?"  Saying which he yawned and eyed
the other mischievously.  "Man," he said, with
twinkling eyes, "ye'd mak' a bonny scarecrow."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, have done!" broke out Murray of
Broughton (for he it was) in a shrill, peevish
voice.  "What good can such filthy nooks and
crannies avail us?  I am like to die," he wailed
on, and started coughing, with his hands clutching
his sides.  Already the Prince's secretary,
broken in health, haunted by the constant fear
that the Chevalier whom he loved sincerely was
taken, oppressed also by his own danger, was
coming nearer day by day to his disgrace, driven
onward by the weakness of body and mind which
may make of any man a coward in the face of death.
</p>

<p>
His face was drawn with sickness and anxiety.
In his pale haunted eyes there flickered a sleepless
dread.  Murray had all the loyalty, but none
of the reckless temerity of the true adventurer.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Cameron had taken tobacco from
his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"A pipe," he said, "I must have, though
all the Elector's red-coats were to sit around this
spot and sniff the dear smell into their red faces."
</p>

<p>
Then blowing a cloud of smoke which sent
poor Murray into a fit of coughing, he turned
abruptly upon the messenger of Muckle John,
saying in Gaelic:
</p>

<p>
"Do you understand Scots?  For our friend
here, whose name you are probably well
acquainted with, has no Gaelic, poor creature!"
</p>

<p>
The man nodded.
</p>

<p>
"What is your name?" asked Cameron.
</p>

<p>
"My name is Donald Grant, and I am from
Glenmoriston," said the other.
</p>

<p>
"A Grant," sniffed Cameron; "well, well,
we canna all be Camerons."
</p>

<p>
He drew up his legs and sat with his elbows
on his knees.
</p>

<p>
"What is your news?" he asked.  "Is it of
the Prince?"
</p>

<p>
"Partly&mdash;and partly not."
</p>

<p>
"That's a braw answer," snapped Cameron.
"It's unco like maybe, and maybe no.  Ye're
muckle confidential, you Grants."
</p>

<p>
"I have a letter," said he, "from one well
known to ye&mdash;Rob Fraser."
</p>

<p>
"Rob Fraser!  I ken nane o' that name.
Oh, bide a wee!  Ye mean a laddie?"
</p>

<p>
Grant nodded.
</p>

<p>
"That same," he replied.
</p>

<p>
Cameron drew in a cloud of tobacco and sent
it floating in rings above his head.
</p>

<p>
"Yon's a bonny one," he murmured, and
then, cocking an eye upon the other.  "Where's
the letter?"
</p>

<p>
Grant drew it carefully from his stocking.
</p>

<p>
Cameron read:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"This to tell you that the treasure is
discovered, and that unless it be put in a safe place
all will be lost.  The bearer of this letter can be
trusted.  Come to me at a place that this man
will show you, for the Prince is with me, and is
in need of you and some gold.  ROB FRASER."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Humph!" grunted Cameron.  Then he
took to reading it again, weighing every word.
Once he stared for a very long time at the
messenger, but the followers of Muckle John were
chosen carefully.  The expression of Grant's
bearded face displayed no emotion whatever.
</p>

<p>
Presently, knocking the ashes out of his pipe,
he pursed his lips, and handing the letter to
Murray, frowned and pulled at one ear, humming
and keeping time with his foot&mdash;the very picture
of a man wanting to go all ways at one and the
same time.
</p>

<p>
"It looks genuine enough," he said grudgingly
in Murray's ear, "but I've no knowledge
of the laddie's writing."
</p>

<p>
"Who is Rob Fraser?" asked Murray with shut eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I had near forgot myself; but he was useful
that night on the shore of Arkaig.  Maybe ye
tak' my meaning?"  Saying which he winked
and looked meaningly at the other.
</p>

<p>
"Then what does he ken of where the stuff
lies?" whispered Murray.
</p>

<p>
"About as much as the trout in the burn,
which maybe is none so little after all."  And
again he winked and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Will ye go, Archie?"
</p>

<p>
"I canna just say.  It looks uncommon like
a trap, and yet..."  He broke off suddenly
and addressed the man Grant.
</p>

<p>
"What is this boy like?" he asked sharply.
</p>

<p>
"He is short and open-faced, and is dressed
in the Fraser tartan.  He is dark and speaks
good Gaelic."
</p>

<p>
"That's Rob sure enough.  Where has he
been since he left Lochaber?"
</p>

<p>
"He was captured and laid in Fort Augustus,
but he has escaped and is now Glenmoriston
way."
</p>

<p>
"Glenmoriston is a far cry," said Cameron.
"Did he send no word beside this?"
</p>

<p>
"He said, 'There's a muirfowl snared,'
though I did not take his meaning."
</p>

<p>
"He said that?" said Cameron in a sharp
voice.  Then turning to Murray he grasped his
arm.  "Ye hear that?" he cried.  "It's Rob
right enough, and the Prince with him."  He
snatched up the letter again.  "Gold," he
repeated, and back came the frown.  "No,"
he said under his breath, "I'll take no gold.
I seem to scent treachery in the word gold.  What
need has the Prince with such?  It's something
mair substantial he'll require.  Murray," he
broke off, "how much have ye upon you?"
</p>

<p>
"A hundred louis d'or&mdash;nae mair," said he.
"But tak' it, Archie&mdash;only leave me ten for my
ain needs."
</p>

<p>
The coins again changed hands and Cameron
again addressed Grant.
</p>

<p>
"What other news do ye bring?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"There is word," Grant replied, "that the
soldiers are moving south."
</p>

<p>
He took to rummaging again in his shirt and
drew out a piece of tartan&mdash;a tangled, stained
fragment about the size of a man's hand.
</p>

<p>
"One who shall be nameless," said he, "has
ordered me to give this to Murray of Broughton,
begging him to put it into Lovat's own hands."
</p>

<p>
"It is a warning," gasped Cameron, "he
says they are moving south."
</p>

<p>
Murray showed no relish for the business.
</p>

<p>
"I have no wish to speak with Lovat," he
replied, "I am the last man from whom he
would take such a message."
</p>

<p>
"Tuts, Broughton," said Cameron impatiently,
"at a time like this private misunderstandings
are out of the question&mdash;ye may
save him from the scaffold."
</p>

<p>
"I would," retorted Murray sourly, "I could
bring him to it.  But give me the rubbish, I'll see
he receives it, though it's poor thanks I'll get."
</p>

<p>
"You misjudge him, man&mdash;he's dour but
he's old.  This man here has brought it from
the Prince belike, who else?" he swung round
on the messenger of Muckle John, "you are a
Jacobite I take it?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The man shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I am a Jacobite where my ain race are concerned,"
he replied, at which Cameron regarded
him gravely, and seemed somewhat suspicious
and uncertain what to make of him.
</p>

<p>
Then turning to Murray he drew him outside
the place, and they lay about a dozen paces
distant amongst the heather.
</p>

<p>
"Ye ken what this means, Murray?" he
said.  "There's some one must warn Lovat.
It's the Prince has sent word&mdash;leastways, ye
can tell Lovat so, it will hearten the old man.
Should he be taken the Highlands will lose heart.
Get him carried by night Badenoch way.  Could
he win to Cluny's cage he would be as snug as
a rat in a hole&mdash;and no sic a bad simile, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll go," said Murray, staring with tired
eyes across the glen.
</p>

<p>
"I'm no taken with this fellow here," went
on Cameron, looking over his shoulder, "and yet
what more can I want?  He carries the daft
words I gave to Rob just to impress him, and
send him like a hare out of Arkaig&mdash;he warns us
for Lovat.  Oh, John, what can ye mak' o' it?"
</p>

<p>
For a long time the other continued to stare
into empty space.  Then turning his head slowly
he let his tragic eyes rest on Cameron.
</p>

<p>
"I know he is no true man," he said,
sombrely, "but how I know I cannot tell you.
And yet he is no Government man&mdash;that I am
sure.  So I give it up!"  His tone dropped
into silence, and sighing heavily he drew in his
breath to cough.
</p>

<p>
"Then I will go," said Cameron abruptly.
"Good-bye, John; keep watch for a French
ship and send word when it shall come."
</p>

<p>
So shaking hands they parted without another
word, never to meet again.
</p>

<p>
The sun was up and the glen lay clear and
lifeless when Cameron and Grant began their
weary journey northwards.  The last they saw
of Murray was his stooping form crawling over
the brow of the hill opposite, leaning heavily
upon his stick, like a wounded crow limping with
broken wings.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
After the futile scheme for the continuation of
the war&mdash;which as all the world knows resulted
in only a few hundred men (no Frasers)
assembling&mdash;all further resistance was at an end,
and Lord Lovat, who throughout had no intention
of giving any personal demonstration of
disloyalty, returned to his island in Loch Morar.
</p>

<p>
On a spring day late in May when the countryside
was bright with the promise of flowers and
the birds sang upon every tree, Murray of
Broughton visited him, and inside the hut where
he lay waiting for news of a French ship,
handed him the fateful scrap of tartan&mdash;the
second warning of Muckle John.
</p>

<p>
Lovat was lying upon the floor with his back
against that same strong box that Rob had
carried from Gortuleg House, unshaven and
dishevelled with privation and distress, and
none too glad to see his visitor.
</p>

<p>
At the four sides of the island a Fraser was
on guard watching the shore&mdash;a dozen more
sat around the hut, while on the surrounding
hills about Morar there were others spying the
glens below, intent on the chance approach of
the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
Lovat, who flattered himself he could guess
any man's errand, greeted Murray distantly and
waved him to a stool.  He took a pinch of snuff
himself, but seemed in no mind to show a like
hospitality to his guest.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you were in France by now," he
said at last.  "It were best for us all if you
could steer clear of the Government."
</p>

<p>
"I do not take your lordship's meaning,"
answered Murray flushing.  "I, at any rate,
have had no dealings with the Government."
</p>

<p>
"But that same Government would like
fine to have some dealings with you, my
man, and supposing they had, supposing they
had..."
</p>

<p>
He looked at him keenly, then laid one finger
against another in a manner very typical.
</p>

<p>
"It was a wicked business," he said, "and
had I not moments of dotage I would never have
even seemed to have sympathized with it,
Murray.  But what could an old man do?  I
had no power&mdash;no influence&mdash;I was deserted
by the Lord-President, a man I trusted like a
brother.  It was a cruel attack on the crown,
Murray, and well ye ken it.  What men can
do to rectify the wrong we should do, even if it
goes against the grain."
</p>

<p>
Murray listened at first without much
comprehension, then with a quickening suspicion
of treachery in the air.  He realized that Lovat
was ready as ever to turn his coat.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," he cried, "I am not here for that."
</p>

<p>
Lovat, who had never imagined he was there
for any other purpose, regarded him with his
customary contempt.
</p>

<p>
"Then you are a greater fool," he rasped,
"than even I took ye for.  What have you to
gain by your silence?  This is the last rising
for the Stuarts.  There will be nothing now but
the English and the English tongue.  It makes
me sick to see a man crying out against what
must be."
</p>

<p>
Murray shook his head and rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"I have come," he said simply, "at some
inconvenience to myself, to do you a service.
Here is a token that I doubt not ye ken well and
so I wish you good-bye," and handing Lovat
the piece of tartan he prepared to leave.  But
with a strange hoarse cry the old man struggled
to his feet.  He was beside himself with rage.
</p>

<p>
Murray, too amazed to move, hesitated in the
doorway, and catching up a stick Lovat struck
him down before he could raise an arm to defend
himself, or avert the blows.  Indeed, he lay as
though stunned with horror or too broken in
body to protect himself.
</p>

<p>
There was a noise of footsteps outside and a
dozen men prevented the Fraser from injuring
him further, and after a while he rose and leaving
the hut reached his boat.  His face was white
as death, but in his eyes, hollow with fever and
privation, there gleamed like a secret fire such
a mad hate and anger that the boatman pulling
him out upon the silent loch watched him
narrowly until they reached the shore.  For a
minute or two he did not move, but still crouched
with his eyes upon the way they had come, then
groping with his hands until he reached the
beach, paid them without question, and saying
no word passed up the shore and out of their
sight&mdash;a man long since broken in health for
the cause and full of bitterness of heart, but now
fired with an undying personal hatred.

CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
THE CAVE IN GLENMORISTON
</h3>

<p>
"Muckle John," said Rob, as the cart came
to a standstill, and his companion had kept a
tight mouth for a full half-hour after his last
curt words, "Muckle John, why did you rescue me?"
</p>

<p>
"Why indeed?" he replied dourly enough.
</p>

<p>
Acting on a sudden impulse Rob leapt over
the side of the cart upon the bank of grass beside
it, and began to walk in the direction they had
come.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going?" cried Muckle John,
startled for once.
</p>

<p>
Rob paused and spoke over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not the one to take favours from you
nor any one," he said.  "I know fine why you
wanted to keep me safe; and now that you've
lost the thing you sought I'm no more to you
than a peewit's egg."  With that he set off
again towards Fort Augustus.
</p>

<p>
"Stop, Rob!" shouted Muckle John.
"What's taken ye?" and flinging his legs
over the side of the cart, he began to run in
pursuit.
</p>

<p>
"Rob!" he cried again, and came up with him.
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"What has come over ye?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Would ye hang yersel' just to spite me?
What's done is done, Rob; and I'm no perhaps
the saint ye took me for.  But save ye I will,
and that's the naked truth."
</p>

<p>
"Let me pass!" cried Rob, and took a step
to the right of him.
</p>

<p>
"Very good," he replied grimly, "but come
ye will," and catching him into his huge arms,
he flung him suddenly upon the ground and
bound his wrists.  Struggle as Rob would it
availed him less than nothing, and so at last,
with hands tied together and a dirk-point in
his ribs, he must needs march in the direction
Muckle John wished.
</p>

<p>
For a full hour they trudged on thus, leaving
the cart to care for itself.
</p>

<p>
Then at last he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" he said, holding out his wrists.
"I have had enough of this."
</p>

<p>
"Brawly spoken!" said Muckle John, and
he cut the thongs.
</p>

<p>
"Where," asked Rob, "are you taking me,
for I have important business in the south?"
</p>

<p>
"What might that be?"
</p>

<p>
"It is the warning of Lord Lovat."
</p>

<p>
"It is done already; I have sent a man two
days since."
</p>

<p>
"Am I, then, your prisoner?"
</p>

<p>
His captor broke into a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Just a visitor, Rob," he replied, "and
nothing more."
</p>

<p>
In this manner they travelled northwards,
passing through wild, desolate glens and black
ravines, scaling rugged hills, seeing few upon
the road, and more in the heather.  Several
times in the night they saw the camp-fires of the
English, but Muckle John seemed as familiar
with the country even in black darkness.  During
the day they lay close hid in some cranny of the
rocks, or skulked upon the crest of a hill, watching
the surrounding district for sight of moving
troops.
</p>

<p>
It was nearing nightfall two days after Rob's
escape from Fort Augustus when they entered a
small, precipitous glen, shut in by lowering,
ragged crags, while through its tortuous course
a burn was drumming in a melancholy undertone.
No drearier spot had ever met Rob's eye.
Deserted even by the eagles, it might have been
a habitation of the dead.
</p>

<p>
Now at the side of the burn a shattered pine
tree was standing against the evening sky, and
as such gruesome thoughts passed through Rob's
mind he raised his eyes, and a cry came and died
unuttered on his lips.  For on a solitary branch
about the height of a tall man from the heather,
a human head was stuck with the hair still fluttering
in the breeze; while underneath dangled
the faded uniform of an English soldier.
</p>

<p>
"Look!" cried Rob.
</p>

<p>
But Muckle John only nodded absently.
</p>

<p>
"They're as common as berries hereabouts,"
he replied.
</p>

<p>
"Hereabouts?" repeated Rob.  "Then
whose land is this?"
</p>

<p>
For answer Muckle John sprang upon a rock
and with his hands hollowed about his mouth,
sent a clear, penetrating call.  From up the
hillside a reply came swift as an echo.
</p>

<p>
"Some call it," he said, "the country of
Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
Before Rob could reply several Highlanders
came running down the hill-side, and greeted
his companion with every sign of respect and
pleasure, all of which he took very naturally.
</p>

<p>
Then passing onward they came to a narrow
defile with a man on guard at the entrance, and
continuing their way, reached the opening to a
cave.
</p>

<p>
In the sheltered ground which lay before the
cave three men were engaged around a fire, and
the smell of cooking drifted in a cloud about
their stooping forms.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," said Muckle John, making way for
him to pass, "will you step inside, for if I am
not mistaken there is one who will be pleased
to see ye."
</p>

<p>
Without a word, but anxious to know to
whom Muckle John could refer, Rob entered the
cave.  For a moment the darkness of the place
made him think he was alone.  Then of a
sudden he made out the form of a man lying
upon the floor; and with a quick fear he knelt
down and recognized Archibald Cameron, bound
hand and foot.
</p>

<p>
It took Rob but a couple of slashes with his
skian dhu and Cameron was free of his bonds.
</p>

<p>
Sitting up he groaned and surveyed Rob with
a whimsical smile.
</p>

<p>
"This is a queer manner of hospitality,"
said he.  "If ye had mentioned the name o'
the gentleman you were serving I would have
taken the hint kindly."
</p>

<p>
"I serving?" broke in Rob, "I do not understand."
</p>

<p>
Cameron shrugged his shoulders cynically.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe ye do not remember the letter,"
he said very politely, "maybe ye are not Rob
Fraser?"
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Cameron," replied Rob, "this is no
time for quarrelling.  I know of no letter, and I
am a prisoner like yourself.  We are both in the
hands of Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
"Muckle John!  So that's how the wind
blows, eh?  Oh, I begin to see.  Poor Rob,
you're aye the scapegoat.  Muckle John,
indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"You know of him?"
</p>

<p>
Cameron snorted.
</p>

<p>
"Wha does not?" said he, "there's few
between here and Rome has not heard tell of
Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
"Then is he Hanoverian?"
</p>

<p>
"He's mair like a kite that hovers above
the squabbles of other folk."
</p>

<p>
"Then what does he want with us?"
</p>

<p>
"Money."
</p>

<p>
"It's little of that I have."
</p>

<p>
"You, Rob?  Oh no!"  And he smiled in
a way as though the idea tickled him.
</p>

<p>
Very greatly puzzled, Rob fell back on silence,
and presently Muckle John himself entered the
place.
</p>

<p>
He was in Highland dress and made a great
appearance of surprise at seeing Cameron, which
ill accorded with the reception that unfortunate
gentleman gave him.  Then turning, he clapped
Rob upon the shoulder and bade them both be
seated.
</p>

<p>
"It's poor hospitality," said he in Gaelic;
"but these are sad times, Dr. Cameron.  Old
campaigners like us know there's thin rations
when one takes to the heather."
</p>

<p>
"Come, sir," replied Cameron, still standing
and replying in Scots, "what is it you want?
I ken ye fine, and well ye know it.  It is not for
the pleasure of my company that your cutthroats
brought me here.  But I warn you there
will be a reckoning for this.  There will be a
bonny ending for you, sir, when it is known in
Lochaber."
</p>

<p>
"Lochaber," sneered Muckle John.  "While
there is a guineapiece buried in Lochaber neither
you nor the Prince himself would raise a Cameron
to his side."
</p>

<p>
"Braw words for a nameless man," cried
Cameron bitterly, but very red about the neck.
"Hark, Rob, for maybe ye will never hear the
like again."
</p>

<p>
"I am no nameless man!" roared Muckle
John; "and well ye know it."
</p>

<p>
Cameron smiled quietly to himself.
</p>

<p>
"Then the greater the smirch on your clan&mdash;though
I'm no just remembering the tartan,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
At that Muckle John, flinging back his stool,
leaped to his feet, and called out a name which
no man Lochaber way can hear in silence.
</p>

<p>
For an instant, indeed, Cameron seemed on
the point of springing upon him; then restraining
himself with an effort, he spoke in a very
polite tone:
</p>

<p>
"You will perceive," said he, "I have no sword."
</p>

<p>
But now that the thing was said Muckle John
appeared greatly put about and anxious to
smooth it over.  He shrugged his shoulders and
fiddled with the brooch upon his plaid.
</p>

<p>
"Tuts, Dr. Cameron!" he said.  "I spoke
over warmly."
</p>

<p>
But Cameron only frowned and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I have no sword," he said again.
</p>

<p>
There was no mistaking his meaning.  With
a shrug Muckle John turned and left the cave.
</p>

<p>
"Do not fight him, doctor," broke in Rob.
"It is sheer madness.  Oh, how could ye fall
into such a trap?  It is to kill you he led you
on."
</p>

<p>
"Rob," replied Cameron, "you are too
young to understand the ways of a Highland
gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"But surely you are more service to the
Prince..."
</p>

<p>
"Whisht, boy!  Dinna haver.  Ye heard
what word he used.  A man's name means mair
than a whole clan of Princes."
</p>

<p>
After that there was nothing more to be said.
</p>

<p>
The doorway darkened again and Muckle
John entered with two claymores and targes.
</p>

<p>
"It is lighter outside, Dr. Cameron," he
said, as though they were about to discuss a
friendly bout together.
</p>

<p>
"As you will," replied Cameron with
equanimity, and bowed to him to take the lead.
But Muckle John bowed still lower, and with
his head cocked very high Cameron passed
through.
</p>

<p>
A level place of about ten feet square lay before
the cave, and clustered on a ledge above sprawled
and sat some dozen ragged Highlanders, who
evinced no sort of interest whatever in the
impending encounter.
</p>

<p>
Cameron swung his blade once or twice and
tested the steel upon the ground.  The targe
he threw aside.  Then taking off their coats
they rolled up their sleeves, and saluted each
other.  Seeing that the thing was past mending,
Rob took his seat very sadly upon a mound and
wondered how it would all end.  The grey,
desolate sky, the silence of utter solitude, the
cluster of dirty, unmoved Highlanders, and
above and upon them all the smirr of thin hill
rain, made his heart sink like lead.
</p>

<p>
And in the weary greyness of it all, two men
about to fight to the death over a hasty word.
It was a situation typically Highland.
</p>

<p>
Cameron, as sturdy a figure as one could wish
to see, was standing on guard right foot
foremost, his left arm behind his back.
</p>

<p>
Muckle John was facing him, his long hair
loose about his neck, his vast forearms bared,
perfectly motionless, a figure of colossal strength.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there was a faint scuffle and footsteps
in the entrance way.
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Cameron&mdash;Dr. Cameron!" said a low
voice, with the round softness of a foreign accent.
</p>

<p>
They all looked towards the narrow passage
which led from the valley below, and Rob sprang
to his feet at the sight.  For standing there,
dressed in faded, tattered clothes, thin and
harassed, but with a smile upon his lips, was
Prince Charlie.
</p>

<p><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
THE HOLDING OF THE PASS
</h3>

<p>
He was very different to the gallant figure of
Inverness and Edinburgh days.  Weeks of
wandering in the wildest Highland country had
brought out his finest, most admirable qualities.
Hardship, that strange test of man, had made
him far dearer and more romantic than he had
ever been before.  There was no jealousy of
Irish favourites now&mdash;no dread of English
influence when St. James's should be reached&mdash;all
that was gone never to return.  There was
instead a Prince in a tattered kilt, and a dirty
shirt, bare-footed and with a gun in his hand,
a pistol and dirk by his side&mdash;a man just like
themselves and thrown by the harshness of
destiny upon their loyalty and succour.
</p>

<p>
Here was a Prince indeed, one who could
march and shoot and have a merry word at the
end of the day.  Had they known what was in
him a year before, who can say but the
Highlands would have risen to a man.
</p>

<p>
To Rob he was wonderful, just because he
was human and in distress.  Even to Muckle
John, strange medley of contradictions as he
was, there was present in the harassed figure
in the opening to the cave an emotional appeal
like the lilt of an old song.  Some day he knew
he would compose a melody for his beloved
chanter.  The very notion of it brought a lump
to his throat.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Prince had looked them all
over with his keen frank eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," he said in an utterly exhausted
voice, "I crave your pardon for interrupting
your sport; but I am, as you see, a fugitive
and hard pressed.  It is good to come upon you,
Dr. Cameron, so unexpectedly, for I have sore
need of your guidance at this time."
</p>

<p>
Then, turning to Muckle John, he looked him
up and down.
</p>

<p>
"I seem to remember your face, sir," he said.
"If this is your country, may I claim the rights
of Highland hospitality?"
</p>

<p>
"Your Highness..." broke out Cameron.
But he shook his head at him.
</p>

<p>
"No Prince to-day," he said, "but only a
hunted man, with more thought for his next
meal than the Crown of England itself."
</p>

<p>
With a start Muckle John came forward and
knelt at his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Your Highness," said he, "I hold this
country by right of my claymore, and the guns
of these men of mine; what my name is, is neither
here nor there, and what my manner of life is ye
can maybe guess, and why these two gentlemen
are here ye will learn from their ain lips.  But
it will never be said I took advantage of any
man's distress, least of all the sad plight of your
Royal Highness."
</p>

<p>
Cameron, who had been fidgeting during
these remarks, broke in hurriedly with a very
red face.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot imagine to what you refer, sir,"
he said, eyeing Muckle John.  "No one has
anything to learn from Rob and me regarding
one who is as true to the Prince as you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Sir," returned Muckle John bowing to him
gravely, "you will not find me forgetful of such
words."
</p>

<p>
Before any one could say further the Prince
interrupted them, and thanked Muckle John in
a broken voice.  Then, taking Cameron aside,
he asked him how soon they could win their
way to Badenoch, where he was to meet Cluny
Macpherson, and to hear news of the French
ships.
</p>

<p>
Cameron was about to reply, when a shout
from somewhere down the glen made them
both halt and look towards the watchful
figure of Muckle John.
</p>

<p>
Something seemed to have turned his body to
stone.  Rob, who was nearest to him, stepped
quickly to the spy-hole commanding the valley,
and stared down the rocky slope.
</p>

<p>
For a moment he detected nothing; then,
with a gasp of horror, he observed tiny blots
of red running like ants among the rocks,
coming ever nearer&mdash;red-coats following upon
the trail.
</p>

<p>
A hand touched him upon the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Not a word of this to the Prince," whispered
Muckle John, "but do as I bid."  And he led
him a little away.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Rob," he said, "let what happened
in the past have the go-by, and dinna think
ower hardly of Muckle John.  I liked ye fine,
Rob, and when you wrote that letter from the
fort I could have cried at the daft spirit of it.
Well, Rob, there's the English, and here are we;
and some one must hold this pass if the Prince
is to win through."
</p>

<p>
"But cannot we run for it?"
</p>

<p>
"He is too tired for that, Rob, and in the
open country we should be shot down like
hares.  Now, away with ye all, and take Grant
here to guide you.  Make for the south, and
dinna stop putting leg to earth for an hour.
After that I can promise no more."  Turning
aside he beckoned to his men, and placed them
in position along the side of the slope.
</p>

<p>
Rob rejoined the Prince and Dr. Cameron, and
described the situation.  For long Charles was
set upon aiding in the defence; but the
knowledge that such a course would probably seal
the fate of his friends, persuaded him on flight.
There was not a moment to spare.
</p>

<br>
THE HOLDING OF THE PASS.
</p>

<p>
Accompanied by the man Grant, and bidding
a hasty and melancholy farewell to Muckle
John, they hurried down the hill-side and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Rob let them go in silence.  The Prince
was safe for the present, and with him Cameron
and the keys to the treasure.  For him, as for
Muckle John, there was nothing but danger,
even if they won through in the defence of the
pass.
</p>

<p>
Presently the first shot rang re-echoing down
the desolate glen, and he crept forward to where
Muckle John sat with a musket across his knees.
</p>

<p>
"Rob!" he cried, in a voice half anger,
half surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I could not go," he said simply.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Muckle John looked at him queerly.
</p>

<p>
"Man, Rob," he said at last, "you're a
rare one.  But what of Mistress Macpherson?
Promise me that you will take to your heels
when I tell ye, and go straight for Inverness.
She will shield you till better times.  Promise,
Rob."
</p>

<p>
"I promise," replied he.
</p>

<p>
Next moment the firing started in earnest.
</p>

<p>
Rob took in the situation at a glance.  It was
very improbable that the soldiers had come
upon them by accident.  They most certainly
knew that the Prince was in hiding in the cleft
of the hill.  To surround the place was
impossible.  The only way was to rush the defence,
and carry the pass by storm.  The reckless
manner in which they exposed themselves
pointed to the prize they had in view.
</p>

<p>
As he looked down the glen, lying full length
upon a smooth-faced boulder, something in
the appearance of a soldier standing a little
apart made him call to Muckle John and point
him out.
</p>

<p>
At that very moment, however, the man took
off his hat to wipe his brow, and they recognized
the cunning features of Captain Strange.
</p>

<p>
"The crows are gathering," said Muckle
John in his sombre voice, and taking careful
aim he fired at him, and sent his hat flying
from his hand.
</p>

<p>
"A miss!" he cried, bitterly; and, as though
the report of his gun were the signal for the
advance, the soldiers began to move rapidly
towards them.
</p>

<p>
What Strange was shouting to them Rob could
not hear; but probably, elated at the chance
of capturing the Prince, and vying with one
another in scrambling up the precipitous place,
they were surprised to see a dozen of their
number riddled with bullets before they had
come to within a hundred yards of the pass.
</p>

<p>
Then, taking cover, they began to move their
way upwards, firing as they came.  It was a
case of a hundred against a dozen; but after
an hour the rocks were dotted with silent
red-coats, and still the little garrison held
out.  Two Highlanders were killed and one
wounded.
</p>

<p>
The Prince had had his chance.  Unless
some unforeseen misfortune had overtaken him
he was safe by now.
</p>

<p>
Calling his men softly, Muckle John dispatched
two with the one who was wounded, thus
reducing his forces to seven, and, lighting a pipe,
he calmly awaited the next attack.
</p>

<p>
It came with a wild rush, and a shattering
fire some ten minutes later.  The English had
planted a dozen marksmen up the hill sides to
command the pass, and under the protection
of their fire the remainder began to run towards
the narrow defile.
</p>

<p>
Half a dozen dropped and still they came on,
and three more of the little band of defenders
fell under the storm of bullets.
</p>

<p>
"Claymores!" cried Muckle John suddenly,
and unsheathing his great blade, he flung down
his musket and charged upon the foremost of
the advancing soldiers.
</p>

<p>
Rushing fresh and swiftly, with the slope to
aid them, they drove the enemy back in
confusion, hewing them down like corn under the
scythe.  But two more men were lost and the
holding of the pass was nearing its end.
</p>

<p>
Last of all to retrace his footsteps into the
narrow pathway was Muckle John, and even as
Rob turned to speak to him a shot rang out
and a bullet lodged in his ankle-bone.
</p>

<p>
"It's all over now, Rob," he said, looking at
the wound.  "I couldn't cover a hundred
yards like this.  Go, laddie, and you, Grant, and
you, Macpherson&mdash;away with you.  I can hold
the place for a time."  With the help of the man
Macpherson he bound a piece of his shirt tightly
about his ankle, and rested upon his other leg.
</p>

<p>
All was very quiet outside.  Evidently the
enemy were gaining breath for the next and
final assault.
</p>

<p>
"Away with you," said Muckle John.
</p>

<p>
But the two men would not leave him.  They
stood with Rob, awaiting his fury&mdash;and they
had not to wait long.
</p>

<p>
"Grant," he screamed, "what is this?  Are
you not sworn to obey me?  And you,
Macpherson?  Oh, that I should be flouted to my
very face!  Begone, or I will kill you with my
own sword!"
</p>

<p>
They were now in full view of the soldiers,
but no shot fell.  Possibly the sight of a wrangle
at such a time was too amazing to be missed.
</p>

<p>
Avoiding his eyes the two Highlanders drew
apart from their infuriated leader, and spoke
together in Gaelic.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going?" roared Muckle John.
</p>

<p>
They nodded, and passing him, strode down
the pass towards the soldiery.
</p>

<p>
Even Muckle John was taken by surprise.
With a sharp cry he attempted to stop them, but
it was too late.  They were twenty yards away
before he had scrambled along the track.
</p>

<p>
Then leaning heavily upon the smooth face
of the rock, he watched them with wistful
eyes, saying no more.
</p>

<p>
"Farewell!" he cried at last; and fetching
out his chanter he began to play the "Battle of
the Clans," at which they turned and saluted
him, and then, swinging their claymores, rushed
upon the soldiers, and slashing right and left,
fell amongst a heap of slain.
</p>

<p>
In the pause that followed Muckle John
changed the tune to the "Lament for the
Children," which is like a moonlit sea for sadness.
All the glen lay silent for a space at his playing;
In a kind of superstitious fear the red-coats
waited, dreading the black hills and menacing
landscape, but dreading most of all the stricken
player up above.  It was Captain Strange who
shook them from their panic.
</p>

<p>
Very cautiously they began to creep upwards,
and at that, Muckle John put away his whistle,
and turning for his sword, saw Rob standing
beside him, a bare claymore in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"You here!" he cried.  "I thought you had
gone.  It was dreaming I was, Rob.  Run,
boy, for the night is close upon us.  Ye won't?
Well, well&mdash;it's a rare spirit ye have, Rob, but
it's like to trip you up this night," and he swept
the passage with his sword.
</p>

<p>
"Guard you my legs, Rob, and when I'm
tired of standing on one foot, I'll lean against the
wall."  So in the deepening gloom, without
further word they awaited the attack.
</p>

<p>
It came very suddenly.  Two soldiers rushed
with a wild shout down the echoing passageway.
One was pierced on the instant by the
point of Muckle John's sword; the other swung
about, and was caught on the turn by a lunge
from Rob.
</p>

<p>
"Two," said Muckle John softly, and eased
his dirk for the short upward stab.  A moment's
pause, and four men came at a cautious pace
towards them.  Muskets they carried, but they
did not level them for fear of hitting the Prince,
for so they took the indistinct figure of Rob to
be.  Instead, they clubbed them, and prepared
to smash down the defence of their sword-play.
At that, however, Muckle John slipped a
pistol out of his belt, and discharged it in their
faces, to their utmost confusion.  One man
screamed, and, holding his hands to his eyes,
dashed headlong down the slope.  His cries
sent a chill to Rob's very heart.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly they charged the place,
driving the foremost men onward from the rear,
and even the quick thrust and stab of Muckle
John could not resist that reckless onslaught.
Within a few minutes the heap of the dead and
fallen men was up to their elbows in that narrow
place.
</p>

<p>
The voice of Strange urging on the fragments
of his force now reached them.  But only
muttering curses and sullen voices followed,
and with a laugh, Muckle John whistled a
Highland rant&mdash;a mischievous, derisive tune,
with a world of insolence in it.
</p>

<p>
It brought its reply, for even as he whistled,
a single man came down the black passage-way,
staying his pace only when he stood within
sword-thrust.
</p>

<p>
"Muckle John," he said quietly.
</p>

<p>
The other ceased his whistling.
</p>

<p>
"At your service, Captain Strange," he replied,
with a faint note of amusement in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Will you have it out with me, Muckle
John?" went on Strange.  "Let it be to the
death, for they will never forgive me this night's
work."
</p>

<p>
"Oho!" cried Muckle John.  "Here's a ploy!
Did they think that such as you could take me?"
</p>

<p>
"Not you; but one whom you have sheltered,
Heaven alone knows why.  Is he still here?"
</p>

<p>
"He left two hours ago and more.  You
must search Lochaber, Captain Strange.  I
doubt you've made a sair muddle of this."
</p>

<p>
The moon was topping the hills, and a soft grey
light stole suddenly down the crags, and fell
upon the face of Strange.
</p>

<p>
"What of your men?" asked Muckle John at last.
</p>

<p>
Strange gave a bitter laugh.
</p>

<p>
"They will not stir," he said, "and if they
do, Rob here can hold the pass."
</p>

<p>
"I am not an executioner," said Muckle
John, "and I have only one leg."
</p>

<p>
"Then I must say that Muckle John was
mair glib with his tongue than his sword.  But
I will not say Muckle John&mdash;I will say..."
</p>

<p>
"Enough!  Let that name bide its time."
</p>

<p>
For a minute Muckle John remained silent,
then limping towards the flat place before the
cave-mouth, he took a long draught of water.
</p>

<p>
"Come on, sir," he cried, "and you, Rob,
guard the pass."
</p>

<p>
He saluted Strange, who had flung off his coat
and rolled up his sleeves, but suddenly he
lowered his sword.
</p>

<p>
"Should I fall," he said, "what of Rob here?"
</p>

<p>
"He shall go free."
</p>

<p>
With that they fell to, and the rasping of
steel upon steel was the only sound in the grim
silence.
</p>

<p>
Muckle John, supporting his weight upon one
leg, foiled the vicious thrusts of his opponent
with steady endurance.  That Strange was a
skilled fencer of the rapier school he realized
at once.  That he was also cunning and agile
he took for granted.
</p>

<p>
Had he been able to act on the offensive, and
bring his vast strength to the attack, no rapier
play could have warded off his great blade and
iron arm, and yet the growing strain upon
his sound ankle was already telling.  He was
like a man fighting against time.
</p>

<p>
With a feint Strange lunged for his neck&mdash;only
a flicker of cold steel, but Muckle John
was a fraction of a second quicker, and his
opponent, recovering, crouched in the
moonlight like a panther foiled in its spring.
</p>

<p>
Rob, in the meantime, had striven to watch
the passage; but no sign of an attack came to
set him on his guard, and few could have turned
their backs upon that fierce contest amongst
the grey, watching crags.
</p>

<p>
For now Strange had changed his tactics,
and strove to lure on Muckle John and catch
him off his balance; but there was more in it
than that, for nearing the moon sailed a belt of
black cloud, and much can be done by one active
as a cat in the darkness.  But Muckle John
was also aware of the cloud and when it
drifted over the moon, and they were plunged
in darkness, he turned silently to his right, and,
kneeling upon one knee, pointed his sword
upwards, leaning meanwhile upon his naked dirk.
</p>

<p>
That Strange would attack on his wounded
side so as to ensure a speedy dispatch, was
more than probable.  It was not the first
time that Muckle John had fought in the black
darkness.  A moment, and a whistle of steel
passed close to his ear, and lunging upwards
with a twist of the wrist, he felt the blade win
home, and a dreadful cry broke the stillness.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the moon passed out of the clouds,
and streamed its feeble light upon the open
space between the rocks.
</p>

<p>
On the smooth surface Strange lay with one
arm outstretched and the other clutching his
breast.
</p>

<p>
"He fought hard," said Muckle John,
staggering to his feet.  "I doubt I've killed
him."
</p>

<p>
The wounded man began to cough, and then,
without a spoken word, turned a little away
from them, and with a shudder lay utterly
still.
</p>

<p>
For a moment they stood above him, then
Muckle John turned to Rob.
</p>

<p>
"Come," said he, "for we must be far from
here before the dawn."
</p>

<p>
And so they passed out of that terrible place,
with all its silent forms on the hill-side and that
one lonely figure huddled in the moonlight,
Muckle John leaning upon Rob's shoulder,
limping towards the west.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
THE WHISTLE OF THE BANSHEE
</h3>

<p>
In the greyness of the dawn Muckle John called
a halt.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," he said, "here is the day and only
a mile covered since last night.  Ye ken what
that means?  Within a few hours reinforcements
will arrive from Fort Augustus, they will
find the body of Strange&mdash;what must follow
then?"
</p>

<p>
Rob shook his head.  Escape seemed impossible.
</p>

<p>
"And yet," said Muckle John, "there must
be a way&mdash;there's always a way, Rob, if you
give your mind to it.  There is no prison that
cannot be broken, no wall that cannot be
scaled&mdash;with luck and a cool head.  I know, Rob, for
have I not done it time and again?  But I've
always had a sound pair of legs.  Let us look
at the situation, Rob.  Within an hour or two
this country-side will be hotching with red-coats.
They think the Prince is hereabouts.  Now I
cannot cover half a mile in that time, and there
is no cover worth thinking about.  Nor is the
ground marshy or I could lie hid to my nose
until it was night.  But there is a way, Rob...."
</p>

<p>
He paused and fingered his ankle very tenderly,
muffling a strip of his shirt tightly round it.
</p>

<p>
"Over the knoll there, Rob, is a ruined castle,
little enough of it left now to be sure, but there
are four walls, a huddle of stones upon the roof,
and a burial-place."
</p>

<p>
"A burial place?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, but there's no harm in that.  There
was a chief of the Macraes buried there, he was
a very queer man it is said, but it's long since I
looked at his stone.  No one ever goes near it
after dark, Rob, and mind ye I'm no just hankering
after it mysel'."
</p>

<p>
"But surely they will search the place?"
</p>

<p>
"Rob," said Muckle John cannily, "there's
searching and searching.  There's a deal in
hiding where folk do not look for ye."
</p>

<p>
Again they started laboriously on, Muckle
John leaning upon Rob's shoulder and supporting
himself with a rough crutch hewn from a
tree upon the hill-side.  Just over the knoll they
saw the grey stones of the old stronghold Muckle
John had spoken of, a poor enough refuge to all
appearances, and certainly one not likely to be
overlooked by the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
Inside the walls the grass was long and rank
and in the midst of the grass stood a slab of
granite upon four other slabs, making a square
memorial very moss-covered and decayed,
marking the burial-place of the Macrae.
</p>

<p>
Opposite it in the wall was a great open
chimney-stack.  To this Muckle John limped,
and staring upwards beckoned to Rob.
</p>

<p>
"See here," he said, "there is about three
feet up a place in the wall large enough for a
small man to lie hid.  You cannot see it for a
very good reason, but it's a bonny spot to hide.
Come, Rob, upon my shoulders&mdash;there's not
a moment to lose."
</p>

<p>
"But what of you?" asked Rob.
</p>

<p>
"Up," said Muckle John, "I see them on
the brow of the hill."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Rob, "I will not go until..."
</p>

<p>
But he had time for no more for Muckle John
had him by the throat and was squeezing the
very life out of him.
</p>

<p>
"Dinna clash words with me&mdash;you Fraser
loon," he snarled, "up ye go or I'll break your
neck."
</p>

<p>
After that Rob was only too ready to get out
of reach of those terrible arms.
</p>

<p>
In the chimney-stack, just as Muckle John
had said, there was a place very cunningly
hollowed so as to be invisible from below, where
a man looking upward saw only a square patch
of sky and the broken masonry that fringed the top.
</p>

<p>
Crouching doubled up with his head upon his
knees, he listened for a word from Muckle John.
But none came.  All he heard was a curious
shuffling and a noise like the shutting of a door.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, it seemed about a mile distant, a
bugle sounded, and very faintly there drifted
to him the echo of a shout.
</p>

<p>
Through the empty place below he heard
the wind crying, and the singing of it in the long
grass, but of Muckle John not a word.
</p>

<p>
Out on the moor he could hear the stream
drumming cheerily over the stones.  It was a
bright spring morning full of the singing of
birds, very difficult to associate with sudden
death and a quick burying under the heather.
Those who had met the English on their jaunts
into the hills had small reason to hope for mercy
and none for the dignity of a trial.  It was
better to leave home by the back door and dodge
the bullets.  In those far-off days an English
soldier at fifty yards was comparatively harmless.
</p>

<p>
Rob craned his ears for any sound of their
advance.  But there was not the smallest hint
of impending danger.  For all he knew they
might be scouring the country-side Loch Ness
way.  They might by this time be a couple of
miles away.  Already he was becoming exceedingly
stiff.  He struggled with a growing temptation
to move one leg just an inch.  Very
cautiously he did so.  He succeeded in making
a noise&mdash;not a loud noise, indeed, but in that
hollow place quite loud enough to make him
turn cold with fear.  But nothing happened,
there was no whisper of spying red-coats creeping
stealthily amongst the ruins, listening for all he
could tell within three feet of his hiding-place.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he heard a rustle in the grass below
him, and a creak like the noise of a boot.  He
was instantly transfixed with terror.  It is well
enough to meet death in the open, though by no
means a pleasant business there, but to sit cooped
up in a chimney unable to see what is happening
above or below is more than human nerves can
tolerate.  He had a tantalizing desire to peep
over the edge, to catch one heartening glimpse
of the green grass below, to assure himself that
a red-faced English soldier was not peering up
or fixing his bayonet to poke it about inside.
</p>

<p>
But he knew in his heart that did he look
down he would most surely see what he most
dreaded, and so he lay still with every bone in
his body aching and one leg tingling with numbness
as though a score of needles were pricking
it from every side.
</p>

<p>
And still nothing happened, and there was
only the crying of wind about the crumbling
walls, and the ceaseless drumming of stream
water on the moor.
</p>

<p>
He fell into a kind of doze at last when the
blood seemed to stop circulating in his body,
and once he knocked his head most painfully
against the sharp edges of the crevice, having
nodded with fatigue.  His eyes would not stay
open, and a terrible struggle against sleep began.
He had already suffered a rude awakening by the
soldiery outside Captain Campbell's tent, and he
was not desirous of undergoing another.  He
began to hear noises that he knew in his heart
did not exist, or if they did were caused by the
creatures of the wild or birds settling for a
moment up above his head.  He took to staring
at the opposite of the chimney where very dimly
he could see the pebbles stuck in the mortaring
and the rude chipped stones.  These he counted
for a time in order to rid his mind of the bayonet.
But always he saw its gleaming steel-cold point
just before his face.  He could see it now.
Surely it was a bayonet?  Rob shut his eyes
very tightly, then opened them again.  It was
still there.  More than that it moved&mdash;it scraped
against the stone just an inch from his foot.  He
saw a small piece chipped neatly off.  He actually
heard it rattle down upon the empty floor below.
</p>

<p>
With a blinding shock he realized that it was
a bayonet&mdash;that they were come&mdash;that in secrecy
and silent as ghosts the place was full of soldiers,
had been perhaps for hours.  Sleep was instantly
banished and fear set him once more alert.  His
only hope lay in utter silence.  Again the bayonet
hovered like a snake within a few inches of his
knees.  He knew the man was staring upwards,
vaguely suspicious, despite the apparent smooth
emptiness of the chimney.  He was not satisfied.
The bayonet worked its way round the place
again.  Another piece chipped off, this time a
larger piece.  Why, Rob wondered, with the
sweat upon his brow, did the man not try the
other side?  It was just as likely there.  Did
he really know?  Was this a little sport to while
away the time?  It was almost more than he
could bear.
</p>

<p>
Very carefully the bayonet worked its blind
course round again, and this time it carried about
an eighth of an inch off his brogue.  Next time it
would be his bare flesh.  Suddenly the bayonet
vanished.  The man apparently tired of it, or satisfied
that there was no hidden place in the chimney,
drew his musket down and all was quiet again.
</p>

<p>
Rob was half-minded to ease his aching limbs
when a peculiar sweet smell came drifting past
him.  There was some one smoking in the
place below, and what was more very close to
the chimney to send the fragrance up the shaft
of it.  Rob considered the matter very carefully.
It seemed possible that the soldier was alone,
and quite unconscious of his presence.  A man
did not smoke in silence unless he was solitary,
and smoking was an idle recreation not
associated with premeditated murder.  Perhaps the
fellow was lost or tired.  Perhaps (most
comforting thought of all) he would fall asleep.  He
wondered just how he was sitting, and whether
he was leaning against the hearthstone with
his eyes half-closed and the top of his head
not so far below him.
</p>

<p>
With the utmost caution Rob leaned forward
and peeped over.
</p>

<p>
It was just as he had pictured it.  In the open
fire-place a soldier was huddled at his ease, his
hat upon the ground, his back against the slab
of blackened stone, the pipe stuck at an angle
in his mouth and his lank hair dishevelled and
on end.  He was dozing.  Even as Rob watched
him the pipe in his mouth slid upon his coat,
where it lay on its side with a thin curl of
smoke twining from the bowl.
</p>

<p>
Rob considered the situation.  He was
convinced that the man was alone, but there was
the likelihood that he had been dispatched there
to await the search-party.  The state of that
district was hardly one to encourage solitary
English soldiers to sleep at their good pleasure.
The ghastly pine-tree within a mile or two of this
very spot was a grim enough reminder of that.
</p>

<p>
Rob was strongly inclined to fall upon him
while he slept, and trust to knocking him senseless
or dirking him as he struggled in the narrow
fire-place.  Those were not gentle times.  Dirking
seemed a very natural action to Rob.  He looked
on the soldier below him as a sworn foe beyond
the claims of pity&mdash;an invader and murderer
of his people.  Under no possible circumstances
could Rob have regarded an Englishman with
sympathy or admiration since for centuries he
had been looked upon as a natural enemy, and
now a very bitter one indeed.
</p>

<p>
But if he failed to kill the man, then the game
was up, and even if he did succeed in his design
they were not much better off, Muckle John
could not reach a place of safety, and another
slaughtered Englishman would only point to
their near presence in the neighbourhood and
redouble the soldiers' previous energies.
</p>

<p>
And then as though to settle the matter once
and for all, a bugle sounded near at hand, the
soldier awoke and scrambled to his feet, there
was a noise of marching on the moor outside and
the splashing of a horse passing through the
burn.  Rob heard an order given and the grounding
of arms.  He listened to the roll-call being
read and the words of dismissal.
</p>

<p>
The short afternoon was closing in, and to
his horror he realized that they were camping
for the night.
</p>

<p>
Into the open room below he heard several
men enter, and their conversation reached him
in his hiding-place.  There was little comfort
in what they said.  As far as he could judge
the officer in charge was questioning the soldier
who had fallen asleep under the chimney.
</p>

<p>
"Seen no one I suppose?"  He spoke with
a Highland accent.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, and I've searched the place high
and low."
</p>

<p>
"Been up the chimney?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Looked under that gravestone there?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, it's not possible to move that."
</p>

<p>
"Call two of the men, we'll soon see to that."
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's silence and then a
sound of heaving.
</p>

<p>
"Can't budge it, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Here let me have a hand."
</p>

<p>
A sudden fear came to Rob that perhaps
Muckle John had taken refuge there&mdash;but no,
what four men could not move it was unlikely
he could lift with his injured ankle.
</p>

<p>
"Sergeant," said the officer, "march back
to the cave where the engagement took place
yesterday with twelve men, leave the other four
with me, we'll spend the night here."
</p>

<p>
"Here, sir&mdash;with that stone?"
</p>

<p>
"It takes more than a dead Jacobite to
frighten me," replied the officer, and a few
minutes later Rob heard the tramp of feet die
away again.
</p>

<p>
It was darkening fast and he wondered what
Muckle John was doing and where he was,
whether if he was lying hid in the heather he
would make a sign, or whether he must spend
the whole frightful night cooped up like a fowl
in a pen.
</p>

<p>
He must have dozed a little when a curious
noise made him start and listen with strained
ears.  It was a familiar enough sound&mdash;just
the sharp crackling of firewood, but there was
a horrible significance in it now, for a whiff
of smoke curling up into his face set his eyes
watering.
</p>

<p>
They had lit a fire in the hearth below.  The
thin wisp of smoke grew into a column swirling
unsteadily upwards.  It became a solid volume
choking and hot.  With a sob of pain and
despair Rob covered his face with his bonnet.  For
a few minutes that relieved his eyes and nose,
but the danger of being suffocated was only
subordinate to being roasted alive.  It was a
great roaring fire they were laying.  He heard
the loose sticks and dried heather falling in
bundles on the blaze.
</p>

<p>
His ears sang with the suffocation of it, his
brain swirled and his breath came in short gasps
as a fish gasps upon a bank.  And then with a
pitiful cry he fell forward, down upon the fire
itself and with a swirl of smoke and sparks, into
the midst of the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
The officer thinking that the blackened, tattered
figure might be the Prince himself hastened to
stamp out the tongues of flame upon his clothes,
and dragging him to his feet stared into his face.
</p>

<p>
"Tuts," he said in a tone of deep disappointment.
"It's only a boy."
</p>

<p>
"It's the lad who escaped," cried a soldier
peering at him; "the Duke offers fifty pounds
for his arrest."
</p>

<p>
"What lad?" asked the officer, eyeing Rob
with some interest.
</p>

<p>
"Rob Fraser, he knows...," but the officer
broke in, "Never mind what he knows," he said
testily, "bind him and set him against the wall."
</p>

<p>
Long after when Rob was come to himself
and his eyes more accustomed to the light from
the great fire he watched the officer at his supper.
He was a small red-haired man with cold blue
eyes and white eyebrows, for all the world like a
badger, and with Campbell written all over him.
It was an evil day when a Campbell could strut
over the country-side at his ease.
</p>

<p>
Having finished his food and offering none
to Rob, who nearly begged him for a mouthful
so famished was he, the officer lit his pipe and
called in his men, telling them they could sleep
along the walls of the place.
</p>

<p>
Greatly affable through meat and drink he
also fell into conversation, and being like most
little men very anxious to show what a terrible
fellow he was, with the spirit of a giant, he
related the tale of the banshee of Loch Fyne,
and told it so capably that the soldiers drew a
little together and sent the bottle round in some
uneasiness.
</p>

<p>
"It came from a lonely island," he said,
"and none saw it pass over the grey face of the
loch&mdash;but there was a mournful cry that seemed
to be far up in the clouds and a cold wind passing
like a wraith along the barren shore.  Oh it was
the rare one the banshee of Loch Fyne, and
some said it lived in the lonely island where the
dead lay, for it always passed that way, and it
never travelled alone."
</p>

<p>
"I don't like these Highland tales," said
one Englishman with a shiver, "least of all
hereabouts.  There was a ghost I've heard tell
in Holmbury Hall..."
</p>

<p>
"Whisht to your ghosts," broke in a large
Lowland Scot, whose eyes were great with the
story of the banshee.  "Captain here has seen
the banshee, have ye no, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Now the officer had never before claimed that
privilege.  It is improbable that he had ever
been to the shores of Loch Fyne, being a Glen
Etive man, and it is also open to question
whether the dreaded banshee was not a
traveller's tale.  However that may be he was
not prepared to disappoint his hearers at so
propitious a time.
</p>

<p>
"Once&mdash;once," he replied, being a man as
truthful as a lie would permit, "only once and
that at midnight&mdash;a clear moon in the sky and
no wind to speak of.  I was a youngster at the
time, barely twenty, and as reckless as could be.
It was always said that the banshee rose from
the ancient burial-place at twelve o'clock, and
floating across the loch set out on her evil
errand.  There are those who heard poor Angus
Campbell wailing all through a winter's night
and his voice up in the clouds, 'Tha e lamhan
fuar: Tha e lamhan fuar!  It has a cold, cold
hand!'"
</p>

<p>
"My goodness," gasped the Lowlander,
dragging himself nearer to the fire.
</p>

<p>
On every face about the dying blaze
superstitious fear was written.  Even Rob, weak
with want of food and full of misery, heard his
teeth chatter at the picture the little man
drew&mdash;for he was an artist in gruesome effects.
</p>

<p>
"Over I rowed," he continued, "and the
whole clachan watched me go.  I rowed out over
the silvery loch under a rising moon, and there
was no whisper of what was to come, not even
the soft music that the banshee..."
</p>

<p>
"What was that?" gasped one of the
soldiers in a trembling voice.
</p>

<p>
They all turned about and listened.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I heard a tune far away," he
whispered, shaking with fright.
</p>

<p>
"Tuts," said the officer, but none too
happily, "it was nothing.  But the tune that
the banshee plays is a queer twisted tune, and
once ye hear it there's no getting away&mdash;what
was that?  I'll swear I heard something."
</p>

<p>
This from the little officer himself set all
aquiver with agitation.  Some one tried to throw
some more wood on the fire and found there
was none, while the two nearest to the open
space in the wall drew so close to their comrades
that they were hunched up together like cattle
in a drove.
</p>

<p>
Rob crouched under the shadow of the wall
overcome with a kindred fear.  Forgotten was
Muckle John&mdash;forgotten was his impending
fate&mdash;there only remained the dreaded banshee and
the far away haunting echo of a tune, and the
strangeness of the place they were in.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come," said the officer with some
attempt at soothing them, "it's queer the way
the courage goes in these forlorn places.  As I
was saying I lay watching the great tombstone
that the moonlight rested upon, when I heard a
bit ripple of music that fairly made the flesh
creep on my bones and my hair stand up quite
crisp and prickling.  And will ye believe me
the stone of the tomb began to rise..."
</p>

<p>
"Listen!" screamed Rob.
</p>

<p>
His shrill warning acted on them like an
electric shock.  They scrambled to their feet
in a perfect paroxysm of terror.  And then far
away like a ghostly measure sounded a lilting,
ghastly melody.  Ghastly it sounded in that dim
place with only the sullen red light upon the
broken, haunted walls&mdash;ghastly just because it
was a trifling mocking catch of tune played in
a grim and heartless manner.
</p>

<p>
But more was to come.
</p>

<p>
"Let us get out of here," groaned one of the
Englishmen in a hoarse voice, but he spoke
too late.
</p>

<p>
For before their starting eyes the top of the
massive tomb began to lift&mdash;lift&mdash;lift, and the
tune to grow clearer coming ever nearer like a
man marching slowly into their midst.
</p>

<p>
Then there was such a scene as that lonely moor
had never seen before and will never see again.
For with one united howl of terror they rushed
together for the door.  And first of them all
was the little officer.  Into the silent night they
tore, tripping, falling, never daring to look back,
but set on reaching Fort Augustus in the swiftest
possible manner.
</p>

<p>
Only once did the little officer pause, having
fallen head-first into a bog, and as he scrambled
out he heard (or says he heard) the thing at his
very heels floating ten feet from the ground and
playing as it came.
</p>

<p>
Rob, unable to fly, was forced to a bravery he
did not relish.  And so with tightly closed eyes
and his head buried under a tuft of grass he
prepared for the end.  Look at that dreadful
sight again he would not.  He heard the mad
tumult of the flying soldiers&mdash;he caught a loud
bang like a heavy door clanging to&mdash;he listened
with trembling limbs to the ghostly melody
dying upon the moor.
</p>

<p>
And then back again he caught the sound of
footsteps, and he knew that the banshee was
come to eat him at its leisure.
</p>

<p>
It was groping across the floor towards him.
Now it was touching him.  Its hands were as
cold as the little officer had said.
</p>

<p>
"Rob!" said Muckle John, shaking him.
</p>

<p>
He uttered a muffled cry partly because of his
mouth being so stuffed with grass, partly through
the shock of it all, but mostly because it was all
so unexpected.
</p>

<p>
Muckle John said nothing but cut him free, and
taking the strips of rope threw them on the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Should they ever come back, which will
only be by day if at all," he said, "they will
know that it ate ye up every scrap.  But I'm
doubting if they will.  Let us make up the fire,
Rob, and take our sleep, for there'll be few
meddling us awhile."
</p>

<p>
"But how could you do it, Muckle John?"
</p>

<p>
He put some sticks upon the embers and began
to eat the remnants of the soldiers' supper.
</p>

<p>
"Did I no say there is always a way, Rob,
div ye but find it.  There are few places
hereabouts that I do not know, Rob, and maybe
that's in my favour.  But if I was to say that
the tombstone is no tombstone at all, and that
Macrea is merely a manner of speech, I'll allow
I might seem to have deceived ye.  But just
as the fox, bless him, knows his hiding-place
before he sets ahunting, so I, Rob, have made wee
preparations long syne.  They may come in useful
some day, and when I lay hid in that same stone
in the year '41 for a private matter, I was glad
enough to have taken the precaution."
</p>

<p>
"What was that for?" asked Rob, his head
nodding with sleep.
</p>

<p>
But Muckle John only handed him a bannock
and a cup of water from the burn.
</p>

<p>
"That would be telling," he said, and wrapping
himself up in his plaid he sat blinking at
the fire.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br><br>
THE DANCE OF THE MACKENZIES
</h3>

<p>
During the mending time of Muckle John's
ankle they lay hid in the broken castle, and
such a tale was told about the banshee that the
place was given a wide berth.  Each of the four
soldiers related the terrible experience to a
dozen other soldiers and those added a trifle
of their own and handed it on so that within a
day the whole of Fort Augustus knew of it,
and soon it was spreading to the searching
parties amongst the hills and within a week
Edinburgh was posting it down to London.
</p>

<p>
Many, indeed, scoffed at the thing but, as
none came to give the banshee a personal test&mdash;the
desire of Muckle John for absolute quiet was
gratified.  The castle was treated with profound
respect for fully a century afterwards.
</p>

<p>
It fell to Rob to scour the neighbouring
country at night for food, and so a week passed
peacefully enough, and one evening with a
promise of fine weather and a starlit night they
prepared to set out again.
</p>

<p>
"Let us make for Loch Carron, Rob," said
Muckle John, "the country thereabouts is
clear of troops and when we hear news of a
French ship in the Sound of Sleat we can go south."
</p>

<p>
"Must we go to France, Muckle John?"
</p>

<p>
"That or Holland, Rob&mdash;but only for a
while.  This will all blow over, and when you
have grown a beard, back you will come and
none will know ye."
</p>

<p>
"But won't you return too?"
</p>

<p>
"I?  That depends, Rob, I doubt but the
country will be too quiet for me.  The Highlands
are no what they were.  I mind the day when
a gentleman could lift a few head of cattle at his
good pleasure.  But there'll be little of that
soon, Rob, and I was not brought up to trade
like a lowland bailie."
</p>

<p>
Somewhat depressed by such a prospect,
Muckle John sighed, and so they set out again
and reached Glen Affrick before the dawn.
There they lay hid under the shelter of a crag
until the evening, when they set out as before
and two days later halted on the shores of Loch
Carron, having encountered no dangers on the
road.
</p>

<p>
At the head of the lock was a small,
mean-looking inn, and outside, sitting on their
haunches, half a dozen rough-looking men&mdash;swarthy,
black-haired fellows in the Mackenzie
tartan.  They were chattering together like
monkeys as Muckle John and Rob approached,
but on seeing them they fell silent and stared
at them both with hostile, insolent eyes.
There was not a man there who did not think
of Culloden the moment he saw them&mdash;Muckle
John with his limp and Rob with hunted
Jacobite written all over him.  There was
little welcome for strangers in those days when
a body of red-coats on the smallest pretext might
burn an unoffending village to the ground.
</p>

<p>
But they said nothing, glowering up at them
under their shaggy brows.
</p>

<p>
Muckle John took them in at a glance.  He
read just what was in their minds, and with a
quiet good-day he passed them and entered
the inn.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," he whispered, "not a move till I tell ye."
</p>

<p>
A haggard old woman was sitting upon a
stool before the peats.  She raised her eyes and
stared at them both for a time without speech&mdash;then
something in the build of Muckle John
set her staring afresh until he bent his head and
looked into her lined, yellow face.
</p>

<p>
"Tha sibh an so," she cried huskily, "you here?"
</p>

<p>
"Whisht!" said Muckle John, "how is it
with you, Sheen?"
</p>

<p>
She crooned at the name he used.
</p>

<p>
"It is well," she replied, "but what of you&mdash;and
what is it I can do?"
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, Sheen," said he, "what of this
place&mdash;is it safe?"
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"There is death here," she said, "Neil
Mackenzie is back from the wars&mdash;he is new
come from the pursuit of the Prince&mdash;you must
fly, and the boy with you.  Did they see you
outside?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded, with his eyes on the door.
</p>

<p>
"We are awaiting news from France," he
said, "how can we leave here&mdash;they would
overtake us."
</p>

<p>
Over the face of the old woman there crept
a look of fear.
</p>

<p>
"Hark!" she said, "there are footsteps
along the road."
</p>

<p>
They all stood listening intently.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer came the thud of feet.
</p>

<p>
"It is himself," she whispered, "Neil Mackenzie
new come from Skye."
</p>

<p>
Muckle John smiled grimly.
</p>

<p>
"From the frying-pan into the fire, Rob,"
said he, and sat down beside the fire.
</p>

<p>
Out upon the roadway they heard muffled
voices and once a man's face looked in at the
window-hole and disappeared very sharply.
</p>

<p>
As for Muckle John he appeared greatly interested
in the peats upon which he was sitting.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there appeared in the doorway a
man of about fifty, of middle height, but with
the broadest shoulders and chest that Rob
had ever seen.  He was in full Highland dress,
with a claymore at his side, and one hand rested
on the hilt of it and the other on his hip.  His
attitude was cool and insolent.  His features
were broad and coarse and his smooth,
clean-shaven face over fat and pink, but there
was no denying the spirit of the man.  His eyes
were full of it&mdash;that, and an ugly malice.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-236"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-236.jpg" alt="HE WAS IN FULL HIGHLAND DRESS, WITH A CLAYMORE AT HIS SIDE.">
<br>
HE WAS IN FULL HIGHLAND DRESS, WITH A CLAYMORE AT HIS SIDE.
</p>

<p>
Muckle John glanced at him very casually
and fell to examining his finger-nails, while Rob
stared at the stranger in open wonder.
</p>

<p>
Behind the man in the doorway there clustered
a half-dozen dirty Mackenzies like cattle beasts
nosing at a gate.
</p>

<p>
Neil Mackenzie, for he it was, set about
ordering a drink for himself and then sitting
down upon a stool he stared at Muckle John
in the same insolent manner, while into the room
trooped the men from the roadside, intent on
the sport.  They had seen Neil at this game
before.  He was the rare one to lay a stranger
by the heels.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe you've travelled far the day?"
he asked in a voice like the bark of a fox.
</p>

<p>
Muckle John looked him over slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe," he replied, and warmed his hands
at the peats.
</p>

<p>
Mackenzie stirred upon his stool.
</p>

<p>
"You are not the only one on the road with
a hacked ankle to-day," he said.
</p>

<p>
"A hacked ankle," retorted Muckle John,
"is mair consoling than a hewn head."
</p>

<p>
So far they had spoken in Scots, but now,
as though to let his men hear how the matter
went, Mackenzie rose to his feet and swaggering
across to Rob gave him a cuff on the head and
said:
</p>

<p>
"Whose young bantam are you, lad, and
what kind of tartan is that for the Mackenzie
country?"
</p>

<p>
Now Rob was not the one to take blows from
any one, least of all before a crowd of jeering
strangers, and had Muckle John not given him
a look there is no saying but that he might
have acted rashly.
</p>

<p>
"There are times," answered Muckle John,
"when a man is grateful for small mercies."
</p>

<p>
Instantly Mackenzie grew very red and took
to breathing quickly, like all Highlanders in a
passion.
</p>

<p>
"I seem to know your face," said he, "but
I do not know the tartan you wear."
</p>

<p>
"It is a strange people you are," said Muckle
John, "who do not know a bard when you see one."
</p>

<p>
"A bard," echoed Mackenzie, "then sing or
play," and he laughed at the rest of them
and winked for what was to follow.
</p>

<p>
"My boy here carries my instrument," he
said, and he drew Rob aside under pretence of
conferring with him.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," he whispered, "hark to the tune that
runs just so," and he hummed a bar, "maybe
it will be called 'Mackenzie's Dance.'  When I
have played it once do as I tell," and he laid his
mouth close to the boy's ear.  "Make your
way out and take the old woman with ye, for
she can give you a hand."
</p>

<p>
Then, turning on the Mackenzies, he smiled
like a man on a pleasant errand, and standing
with his back to the fire began to sing, and at
the first note a strange hush fell over the
Mackenzies, for none had ever listened to
singing like that.
</p>

<p>
The sun had set an hour since and the grey
mist of the gloaming was creeping over the loch
and along the beach.  Far out at sea a boat
was heading shorewards.  Muckle John saw
it through the open window-space.  It was a
boat swiftly rowed and carrying a flag at the
stern.  Mackenzie was watching it too&mdash;a
derisive smile upon his lips.  And as Muckle
John sang he saw the smile and measured the
distance that divided the boat from the land
with a swift glance.
</p>

<p>
"Brawly sung," cried the Mackenzies, laughing
in their sleeves at the rude awakening the
stranger would have.
</p>

<p>
Muckle John paused a moment and drew
his whistle out of his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"If you were to give me the space of an
elbow," said he, "I would play you a tune."
</p>

<p>
"Way there," cried Mackenzie, and they fell
back, leaving a passage to the door.
</p>

<p>
At that Muckle John broke into a lament
called "The Glen of Tears," and in the wail
of it was the sadness of twilight and the story
of it was the passing of years.  Sorrow&mdash;sorrow
and the old days that are gone for
always&mdash;backwards and forwards went Muckle John and
tears trickled down the cheeks of the Mackenzies,
while Neil, their leader, hung his head and
said in his mind, "We will not fall on him yet,
but wait awhile until we have heard another tune."
</p>

<p>
And all the time the boat was nearing the shore.
</p>

<p>
Without pausing Muckle John swung out a
reel, and so brisk was his way with the fingering
and so lively the measure that they fell to
dancing there and then, turning and hooching,
and best of them Neil Mackenzie, a scoundrel if
ever there was one.
</p>

<p>
None noticed how Muckle John had reached
the open doorway.  It was only the pause that
he made (which was pure reckless madness of
him) until they found themselves staring at
each other shamefacedly and looking at Neil
to see what was in his mind.  But he only
grinned, thinking of the rare joke that was
coming and nodded to Muckle John.
</p>

<p>
"Go on," he shouted.
</p>

<p>
Muckle John bowed his head.  On his lips
was a dangerous smile.
</p>

<p>
"I will play a tune," said he, "called 'The
Dance of the Mackenzies'&mdash;it came running
in my head an hour back."
</p>

<p>
"It is the quick mind he has," muttered
a black Mackenzie to his neighbour.
</p>

<p>
"I am not liking the look in his eyes," was
the reply, "he is no fool that big man."
</p>

<p>
But Muckle John was already fingering his
whistle, and it was certainly a taking tune and
yet with something queer about it&mdash;something
that made them glance at each other under
their eyes for dread of they knew not what.
</p>

<p>
And Neil Mackenzie started from his lethargy
too late.
</p>

<p>
For at the last bar there was the noise of
crackling upon the roof&mdash;and the thatch was in
a blaze.
</p>

<p>
With a shout he drew his sword and rushed
for the door, but the stranger was ready for him
and no man in the Highlands single-handed
could hold his own for a minute against the
long claymore of Muckle John.  He stood in
the narrow doorway leaning a little forward,
and with a dirk in his left hand.
</p>

<p>
"Dance!" he shouted derisively as the noise
of the fired thatch grew to a sullen roar.  "Dance,
you dogs!" and flicking the claymore from Neil
Mackenzie's hand he ran him through the
sword arm.
</p>

<p>
Then they came at him altogether, a bristling,
snarling crowd, armed with dirks only and
helpless against his long blade.  He drove them
back with harsh laughter&mdash;fought them back
into the blinding smoke, and standing in the
doorway burst into song again, putting words to
the tune he had played.  In a stricken silence
they listened, while out in the darkness a boat
on the loch halted and rested oars watching the
red flames curling up into the night.
</p>

<p>
"Dance&mdash;dance on the feet of fire!" sang
Muckle John, "Mackenzies tripping it brawly."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly from the room where the smoke was
dense and black a voice called on him to hear
them.  It was Neil himself.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want with us?" he cried.
</p>

<p>
Muckle John stared into the mirk.
</p>

<p>
"Throw out your arms," said he, "and you,
Neil Mackenzie, come out first and stand on
one side."
</p>

<p>
There was an instant clatter of dirks and one
broadsword.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," cried Muckle John, "take this man
away there and pistol him if he shows mischief,
though I sliced his arm prettily enough."
</p>

<p>
Then turning back, Muckle John collected
the arms together and called on the Mackenzies
to come out.  This they did readily enough,
gasping and coughing in the glare of the fire,
and rubbing the smart of it from their aching
eyes.
</p>

<p>
Seeing that they meditated no attack Muckle
John threw their dirks into the blazing house,
and then marched up to them.
</p>

<p>
"I am taking your chief," he said, "as a
safeguard.  If I am followed I will claymore
him as surely as my name is Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
"Muckle John!" they cried aghast.
</p>

<p>
"I thought he was no ordinary man," said
the black Mackenzie to his neighbour.
</p>

<p>
"Muckle John!" repeated the other, "it
is the rare fools we have been, Angus&mdash;I think
I will be getting home."
</p>

<p>
"Come," said Muckle John to Neil Mackenzie,
and without a word they started.
</p>

<p>
But of a sudden Muckle John stopped in his
tracks.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," he said, "make due south, keeping
the sea-line and halt two miles away on the shore.
I have business here," and turning back he
disappeared in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
Near the wrecked cottage he found the old
woman weeping silently.
</p>

<p>
"Sheen, poor woman," he said, "it is not my
father's son would ruin you who know my secret."
</p>

<p>
"You are still nameless?"
</p>

<p>
"Still nameless, Sheen, until I meet the man
who killed my father."
</p>

<p>
"Who will he be?"
</p>

<p>
"Who, indeed?  But I shall know him.
I go abroad again when I can.  Some day
perhaps I shall come across him.  They say
he had a horror of the 'The Pedlars' Reel'&mdash;it
was the tune my father died with in his throat,
and it is the tune, Sheen, that I play whenever
I meet such a man as he may be."
</p>

<p>
The old woman touched his arm.
</p>

<p>
"There is doom coming up the shore," she
said, "I can feel it on the wind."
</p>

<p>
"The boat," said Muckle John, "who was
coming so fast in the boat?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not know, but there is death in the air."
</p>

<p>
Muckle John caught her arm.
</p>

<p>
"Here," said he, "take this&mdash;it is a trifle
but it will buy you another cottage, Sheen.
Good-bye&mdash;it is long till we shall meet again."
</p>

<p>
He stepped past her and crept towards the
beach.  On the shore the boat was beached,
and several men were scrambling up the sand.
One, a tall thin man with a heavy cloak about
him and a stick in his hand, was supported by
two sailors.
</p>

<p>
Muckle John crept closer.  Some Mackenzies
were running to meet the newcomer full of what
had happened.
</p>

<p>
He listened to the tale they told the tall man,
who seemed so faint with illness or the sea that
he had to sit down to hear them.
</p>

<p>
"Who was this man that Mackenzie sent for
us to take?" asked one, the captain of a frigate
evidently.
</p>

<p>
"Muckle John!" cried a voice.
</p>

<p>
At that new life seemed to stream into the
crouching, broken figure on the sand.
</p>

<p>
"Muckle John!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
<i>It was the voice of Captain Strange</i>!
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
All that night Muckle John and Rob sped
towards the south, and at the dawn they reached
the country of the Macraes, where they parted
with Mackenzie, and headed for the shores
of Loch Hourn.
</p>

<p>
There on a desolate, rain-lashed moor, with
salt upon the wind, and the sea birds crying
over their heads, Muckle John called a halt.
</p>

<p>
It was near the end of May, but a bitter day
even for Loch Hourn.
</p>

<p>
"Where do we go now?" asked Rob, shivering
with cold.
</p>

<p>
"Where indeed, for now we are driven
into the English line of march and Knoidart
was the last place I hankered after.  It is
better that we should take different roads, Rob,
we've travelled too long together.  Make you
for the south, Rob, and if all goes well wait
news for me outside Leith.  There is a gibbet
there&mdash;shall we say this day month, and if I do
not come then just go your ways and never
say what took you there.  And, Rob, change
that kilt and for mercy's sake cover your legs
with breeks and decent hose, for the like of you
would be recognized from end to end of Scotland.
They want you, Rob, never forget that&mdash;they
want you as a rebel, but that's havers;
as a prison breaker, but that's neither here nor
there&mdash;they want you just because you ken
where Lovat lies hid, and what came to the
treasure of Arkaig.  What did come to that same
treasure, Rob?  Where was it buried or was it
not buried at all?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say," replied Rob, "for I do not know."
</p>

<p>
Muckle John sighed and then shaking him
by the hand addressed the far distance with a
pensive and melancholy gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Whether a man is mair injudicious as a fool
or a knave must ever be a matter of argument,"
he mused aloud, "but I ken fine which I would
have ye be, Rob," and shaking his head he
began to move away.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, however, he paused and coming
back more quickly led Rob down to the edge
of the loch.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," he said, "what is there to prevent
me from putting you in there?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," said Rob, "but I do not see
what you would gain by that&mdash;I tell you I
know nothing of the treasure.  It was hid while
I sat upon the beach."
</p>

<p>
Muckle John shook his head in the same
forlorn fashion.
</p>

<p>
"I hardly like to leave you, Rob," said he
sadly, "there are times when I wonder whether
you are to be trusted alone.  Many men would
say you were daffing, Rob&mdash;but there's honesty
written all over your face.  I once met another
just like yersel' so I know.  It's a terrible
responsibility to be so honest, Rob&mdash;it maks
other folk uncomfortable.  Good-bye to ye, Rob,
and here's some siller just in case you are
hungry or want a night's lodging.  But be
careful of the wandering bodies Rannoch way,
for they'd cut your throat for a nod and follow
you to London for the clink of a bawbee."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," said Rob, "where do you go
now, Muckle John?"
</p>

<p>
"I make for Arisaig," he replied, "I have
a debt to pay."
</p>

<p>
"A debt?"
</p>

<p>
"Not so surprised, Rob, no man pays his
just debts like Muckle John.  Dirk for dirk&mdash;shot
for shot&mdash;chase for chase&mdash;there is no
honester soul than Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
Rob laughed, though a trifle faint-heartedly,
and in that manner they parted, Muckle John
passing rapidly southwards while Rob watched
him fade into the dreary landscape and become
lost in the cold sea mist.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br><br>
AN UNWILLING ACCOMPLICE
</h3>

<p>
It was at the corner of Church Street on the
week following the engagement at Glenmoriston,
that Miss Macpherson, busied about a few
purchases, stopped very sharply opposite the tavern
of Major James Fraser (commonly known as
Castleleathers) and peered with signs of agitation
at a printed paper hung in the window.  A
casual onlooker would never have known Miss
Macpherson was even faintly moved by what
she read, but a close observer would have seen
her mouth close tightly, her brows droop over
her keen eyes, her hands clutch the parcels in her
arms spasmodically.  It was enough to startle
any woman.  Indeed, most people would have
lost their heads, and done something foolish.
</p>

<p>
For the contents of the paper were principally
devoted to a personal description of one "Rob
Fraser, a rebel at large, dressed in a kilt of the
Fraser tartan with a dark coat&mdash;sixteen years
and over&mdash;of strong build and dark-haired, who
was in arms against the Government at Culloden
and has since broken prison from Fort Augustus,
skulked with desperate rebels and recently killed,
in company with one called Muckle John, a
notorious Jacobite, a number of his Majesty's
forces in the country of Glenmoriston.
Whoever shall lay the said Rob Fraser by the
heels shall receive the sum of fifty pounds," and
so on.
</p>

<p>
There was much more, but Miss Macpherson,
sick at heart, walked slowly away.  It would
not do for her to be seen reading the thing.  Her
mind was stunned for a moment.  She did not
notice where she went, or the passers-by.  It
was only when she knocked against a great man
standing at the corner of the street that she
started and looked up.
</p>

<p>
It was Castleleathers.
</p>

<p>
She knew him slightly as a distant cousin of
Rob's father, but would have gone on her way
had he not greeted her.
</p>

<p>
"A fine day, Miss Macpherson," he said loudly,
as a couple of soldiers tramped past them along
the road, and then in a low tone, "have you
news of Rob?"
</p>

<p>
"No," she replied, "and no news is like to
be good news in these times.  What set him
meddling with such things&mdash;the feckless loon?"
</p>

<p>
He jerked his head towards his house.
</p>

<p>
"Come away in," he whispered, "we must
see what can be done."
</p>

<p>
Together they entered the place and going
upstairs came to an upper room.
</p>

<p>
He was a very heavy, red-faced, helpless kind
of man.  His massive incompetence under stress
of emergency irritated her to tartness.
</p>

<p>
"It was here Rob met that soft-spoken
gomeril, Muckle John," she snapped.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, that it was," he replied, nodding moodily.
</p>

<p>
"And I suspect the man who gave him my
address that evening, Major Fraser."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me, Miss Macpherson, ye say so?"
</p>

<p>
"That I do, my man, and what's more he's
in this very room."
</p>

<p>
With a pathetic simulation of surprise Castleleathers
made as though to look over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"It's yersel'," said Miss Macpherson coldly.
</p>

<p>
He tried to meet her stony stare, but failed.
</p>

<p>
"When ye mention it," he began like a man
struggling to recall a distant event, "when ye
mention it, maybe I did say I was second cousin
to Rob who lived with his aunt near by&mdash;I'm
no denying anything mind ye, I merely say
maybe I did in the course of conversation, a
pleasantry madam, a bit of gossip..."
</p>

<p>
"It's like to be a dear bit of gossip for Rob,"
she retorted, "and that no so far away."
</p>

<p>
"Tuts! you take too serious a view.  It
will all blow over&mdash;all blow over.  There has
been trouble before, I mind the '15, it was just
the same, and before a few months had passed
all the folk were going about their ways just
the same and keeping their claymores oiled for
the next time.  Rob is a lad of spirit, Miss
Macpherson, and they will not take him."
</p>

<p>
But she was not listening to him.  She was
revolving in the depths of her mind some kind
of plan, any sort of crazy plan that would save
Rob.  The day when he could have surrendered
and escaped with a few months' imprisonment
was past; he was now a notorious rebel still in
arms, and associated with desperate leaders
amongst the rebel army.  There was no hope
of shielding him until better days.  It must be
escape across the sea&mdash;or a pardon.  But the
idea of a pardon was, of course, absurd.
</p>

<p>
"What can we do?" she said in a kind of
restrained despair.
</p>

<p>
Castleleathers blinked.
</p>

<p>
"We?" he repeated vaguely.  "I fear that I..."
</p>

<p>
But she froze him with a single look.
</p>

<p>
"I am in no mind for argument," she said,
"and our business is to get Rob free.  I have
at the back of my head a plan of a kind, but it
will need sleeping on."
</p>

<p>
"But I cannot risk my neck even to assist
you, Miss Macpherson."
</p>

<p>
"My man," she replied grimly, "you will
risk your neck if you don't.  Who shielded
Muckle John, that desperate rogue, in Inverness
under Lord London's verra nose but just
yersel'?"
</p>

<p>
"How did ye know?" he whispered, much
taken aback.
</p>

<p>
"I didna," she replied comfortably, "but I
suspected as much."
</p>

<p>
"He was an old friend."
</p>

<p>
"That would tickle the ears of the Duke, he
has a sair grudge against Muckle John, he told
me so himsel'.  He said he'd willingly hang
any one who gave him shelter."
</p>

<p>
Castleleathers shrank back.
</p>

<p>
"He said that did he?" he murmured aghast.
</p>

<p>
She nodded her head.
</p>

<p>
"He's no sae sure of you as it is," she added.
</p>

<p>
He appeared considerably dejected at this,
and said again and again that he did not know
what could be done at all.
</p>

<p>
"We must compel him to sign a pardon,"
said Miss Macpherson, "we must put the fear
of death upon him, Castleleathers.  You are
a very large, powerful man, as great in the chest
as Muckle John himsel"&mdash;she paused, eyeing
him keenly&mdash;"my certes," she cried, "but
there's a notion for you ... could ye no let
on you were Muckle John?"
</p>

<p>
"I ... Muckle John?  <i>My dear lady</i>..."
</p>

<p>
"You are fatter than he and without his
spirit of course, but how can the Duke tell that?
I have a friend inside the Fort, a Macpherson,
third cousin to my mother's step-daughter and
a douce quiet man.  He would do what he can
though he has a sound respect for his neck."
</p>

<p>
"I am with him there," sighed Castleleathers.
"I hope, madam, that you propose nothing rash."
</p>

<p>
"My man," she said stoutly, "when my
blood's up I stick at nothing, be it Duke or
gibbet."
</p>

<p>
After that there fell a most melancholy silence.
The major, who had hoped to spend a peaceful
old age, and who had stepped like a cat among
puddles during the last disturbance, wished
Muckle John far enough and Miss Macpherson
much farther.
</p>

<p>
The whole heart of the warm fire (and it was
a chill day) seemed to have fallen into thin ashes.
He shivered dismally and took a dreary relish
in praying that he might catch his death of cold.
</p>

<p>
Once he screwed his eye slowly about and let
it rest moodily upon Miss Macpherson.  But
she was absorbed in her scheming, and that is
a game that comes painfully to untutored
persons.
</p>

<p>
"I see nothing for it," she said at last, "but
just to shoot him."
</p>

<p>
"The Duke?" gasped Castleleathers.
</p>

<p>
"Who else&mdash;he'd be no loss.  There's little
of the William Wallace in you, my man."
</p>

<p>
"I am not wanting in personal courage,"
groaned Castleleathers, "indeed, I have seen
service abroad, but this is beneath me,
madam&mdash;quite beneath me."
</p>

<p>
Miss Macpherson leaped at a grim jest to
bring him to his senses.
</p>

<p>
"There'll be nothing beneath ye if you don't,"
she said swiftly.
</p>

<p>
He recoiled from such a pleasantry.  He had
always deplored the brutality of utter frankness.
</p>

<p>
"Who knows," he said thoughtfully, "but a
little playful threatening might not win our
purpose, just a pistol waving carelessly in the
hand, and a claymore at the side, the iron hand
under the velvet glove, madam&mdash;ye take me?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll take ye right enough," said Miss
Macpherson, "if Rob's life depends on us two,
there'll be no shirking."
</p>

<p>
"If only my heart were in the work," sighed
the major pensively, "I would not care a bawbee
for the Duke or ony body.  Could you not get
in touch with Muckle John, the Duke is feared
of him belike..."
</p>

<p>
"My man," broke in Miss Macpherson, "you
are slow in the uptake, <i>you</i> are to be Muckle
John."
</p>

<p>
He raised his head at that in a speechless
tragedy of silence.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Me?</i>" he whispered.  "<i>Me Muckle John</i>&mdash;oh,
what is this nonsense you propose?"
</p>

<p>
"I have not decided upon it at random,"
she replied, "and it seems practicable.  I have
some knowledge of the Duke's habits, and let
us but once get him alone and we will force him
to sign a pardon for Rob.  He goes south soon,
so we must act at once.  You, Castleleathers,
must wrap yersel' up in a plaid to your nose
and when we find him by himsel' you shall
threaten his life."
</p>

<p>
"But you&mdash;where will you be?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall be watching ye&mdash;never fear&mdash;meet
me to-morrow and we'll journey south.  The
final plans I'll devise, and dinna fail me or I'll
tell the Duke how ye knew Lovat himsel', and
they'll take ye to London as a witness."
</p>

<p>
"No, no," cried the major in a panic of
fright, "I will be there never fear, but it's like
I'll see London in a very different capacity."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br><br>
THE CAPTURE OF LORD LOVAT
</h3>

<p>
As weeks passed on and still the searchers did
not come Lord Lovat's hopes rose, and schemes
no doubt began to run through his mind for a
continuance of the struggle or a reconciliation
with the Government.  It may have occurred
to him to send a diplomatic message to the
Duke of Cumberland at Fort Augustus, but
there is no evidence to show whether he took
any definite steps until it was too late.
</p>

<p>
For long after the fateful visit of Murray of
Broughton he had been prepared for immediate
flight, but as time passed and nothing occurred
to alarm him he took to sitting in the sun or
playing a hand of cards, or brooding inside the
cottage upon the transience of all human
greatness.
</p>

<p>
There were with him about a score of Frasers,
all armed with musket and sword, and Bishop
Hugh Macdonald, who did not desert the old
man in his hour of need.
</p>

<p>
It was on the first of June that the sloop
<i>Furnace and Terror</i> conveying a detachment
of soldiers from the garrison of Fort William,
came sailing down the coast of Knoidart and
Arisaig.  There they landed soldiers who
began to march inland, making for Loch Morar.
</p>

<p>
It was on the north side of the loch that they
espied a man making his way along the
seashore&mdash;a very tall man who limped as he ran,
being surprised in an open patch of country.
Giving pursuit they spread out along the
hill to cut him off, but when the man on the
shore saw them he went away at a great pace,
and had it not been that the loch curves
outwards so as to make escape the more difficult,
he might have gained the head of it, and won
free.  To avoid falling into their hands,
however, he took to the loch and set out swimming
for an island in the middle of it, making good
headway before even they could get within
shooting range.
</p>

<p>
And then, while they hunted for a boat,
he scrambled upon the wooded shore and
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Lord Lovat was sitting before his cottage
as the swimmer waded ashore.  He looked up
having dozed in the sunlight and fallen asleep.
</p>

<p>
Facing him, with water dripping from his
clothes, was Muckle John.
</p>

<p>
For a moment he blinked, and then perceiving
that the soldiers on the mainland were pushing a
boat on to the loch he shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"I was awaiting you," he remarked quietly,
"but I did not look for red-coats!  Even
Murray, your last messenger, came alone."
</p>

<p>
Muckle John shook the water from his coat.
</p>

<p>
"Had I known you were here," he said,
"I would rather have been taken."
</p>

<p>
Lovat was greatly puzzled, so puzzled he
could only gape at him.
</p>

<p>
"Come," went on Muckle John, "there is not
a moment to be lost.  Get you into a boat, and
away with you.  Leave a dozen of your men
here, we can hold them back awhile.  But
when you reach the mainland consider
yourself no longer safe from me."
</p>

<p>
Lovat grinned at that.
</p>

<p>
"How you fight who's to have my poor
body," he replied.  "What if I stay quietly here?
If it must be one or other, better Fort William,
where I shall at least be protected from you."
</p>

<p>
"My lord," returned Muckle John, "you
estimate Fort William over highly.  But let
that pass&mdash;come, sir, if you will not move
I'll put you in a boat by force.  They are
half-way across.  Will you rise or no?"
</p>

<p>
Very slowly Lovat got upon his legs.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go," he said simply, and crossing to the
other side of the island permitted himself to be
helped into a boat, and rowed to the Arisaig
side.
</p>

<p>
For the next hour there raged a battle royal
between the red-coats and the Frasers under
Muckle John.  Again and again they tried to
take the island by storm but the fierce fire of
the defending force drove them back to firing
over the sides of their boats, and in the confusion
no thought was given to the rear of the island
and the flight of Simon, Lord Lovat.
</p>

<p>
At last in a brief respite Muckle John ordered
the Frasers to the boats and pushing off they
rowed with all haste out of range of the island
upon which the English landed in due course.
</p>

<p>
On reaching the mainland Muckle John
said farewell to the Frasers and limping into
the shadows of the trees went his way.  But
late that night in a cave upon the side of Glen
Morar he took the third piece of Fraser tartan
from his sporran and threw it into the fire.
</p>

<p>
"It is a reckoning," he said in his heart,
"that is more fitted for English hands than mine."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Near Meoble on the seventh day of June
the soldiers came upon Lord Lovat hiding in a
hollow tree.  He had dismissed his followers
in order to lead his pursuers off the trail.
Quite alone, sitting upon his strong box, he
surrendered his sword with his customary
dignity and permitted himself to be taken on
board the sloop <i>Furnace</i>.
</p>

<p>
As he was assisted up the side he encountered
Captain Strange looking over the bulwark.
Well he knew Strange's reputation as a spy
and secret agent.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry to see your lordship in this
plight," said Strange with an undercurrent
of malice in his voice.
</p>

<p>
Behind Lovat they brought his strong box, and
when he saw it there he pursed his lips, but
said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"The men report they were on the trail of
Muckle John a day or two since," resumed Strange
meaningly, "anything your lordship can tell us
will not be forgotten.  He is a dangerous man."
</p>

<p>
"My memory," replied Lovat slowly, "is
so short that I cannot recollect.  Was it
Muckle John?  He seemed a small fair man to
me, but my eyes ye ken are no what they were."
</p>

<p>
"I understand," said Strange grimly, and
led the way down to the cabin.
</p>

<p>
There Captain Duff and Captain Ferguson
were awaiting them.  And on the table lay the
strong box over which Lovat had pored so many
hours on the night of Culloden at Gortuleg.
</p>

<p>
Lovat was allowed to seat himself, and having
done so appeared oblivious to the proceedings,
and seemed to doze.  In the box were many
articles of personal value to him and these the
searchers passed over.  But near to the bottom
of the box was a bundle of papers, and these
they grabbed at and began to read.
</p>

<p>
At that point Lovat stirred and looking up
remarked: "You will find nothing treasonable
there..." watching them with a half smile
on his lips.
</p>

<p>
But of a sudden he paled and leant forward.
</p>

<p>
In the hand of Captain Strange was a letter, in
the Master of Lovat's writing.  In some manner
that fatal communication had been overlooked.
</p>

<p>
"Will you let me look at that letter?" asked
the old man smoothly.
</p>

<p>
Strange hesitated and saw the tension in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I fear," he replied, "this must remain in
the hands of the Government."
</p>

<p>
Lovat sank into his chair and shook his great
white head in a melancholy way.
</p>

<p>
"I am too old," he said hardly above his breath.
</p>

<p>
"My lord," said Strange, "this letter is
incriminating in the highest degree.  Have you
recollected yet whether it was Muckle John
you met upon the island on Loch Morar?"
</p>

<p>
Lovat put one fat hand to his ear.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot catch what you say," he remarked
blandly.
</p>

<p>
Strange repeated his question.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry," said Lovat, "but at my age
deafness is very prevalent."
</p>

<p>
And so in due course they took him to Fort
William, carrying him in a litter, finding him
very querulous over the bumpy places, and apt
to gibe at them in Latin to his own cynical
pleasure and their vague annoyance.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br><br>
MISS MACPHERSON AND THE DUKE
</h3>

<p>
On the brow of the high ground close to Fort
Augustus there sat a solitary man wrapped to
his nose in a great Highland plaid.  Night was
falling and a thin drizzle of rain coming out
of the west.  The black outline of hills closed
about the Fort as though to overwhelm it.  No
sound there was but the weary dripping of rain
and the noise of running water over stones.
</p>

<p>
The figure on the mist-ridden hill-side never
moved, but remained as lifeless as the crag
behind him&mdash;part as it were of the tragic
twilight.
</p>

<p>
Down in the Fort lights flickered here and
there, and a horseman plunged out of the
obscure light and entered the gates.
</p>

<p>
The man upon the hill never raised his head
but watched him for all that, the rain pouring
from his bonnet to his plaid and running in
little streams upon the heather.
</p>

<p>
A bugle sounded down below.  Following
hard on its muffled notes came the clanging of
the gates.
</p>

<p>
The Fort was closed for the night.
</p>

<p>
The swift darkness of a Highland night
smoothed out the ragged line of mountain,
obliterating with its travelling shadows the
outlines of the desolate glen, the clumps of trees
about the low-lying country and in a flash the
man upon the hill.  He had become in a breath
of time inseparably of the night itself.
</p>

<p>
Long after a clear whistle sounded from the
pathway below.  It was followed by a softer
longer whistle.
</p>

<p>
With a sigh the man upon the hill gained
his feet, being very stiff and cold with waiting,
and passing over the sodden heather stood
looking about him into the mist.  Presently
two figures loomed into sight.
</p>

<p>
The first of them, wrapped like the man himself
in the folds of a heavy plaid, addressed him
in a familiar voice.
</p>

<p>
It was Miss Macpherson.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Castleleathers," she said, "here is
the man Macpherson, he is letting a rope over
the wall, and he has arranged all.  The Duke
expects a visitor from the west this very night
or maybe to-morrow and he will be alone.
Things are no so strict as they were, and there
is a rumour that he goes south soon.  He thinks
the Highlands are crushed...."
</p>

<p>
"The German loon," snapped Castleleathers
with much contempt, "he cannot tell the
difference between a Hessian and a Macdonald."
</p>

<p>
"Come," said Miss Macpherson, "and say
ye do not think hardly of me if anything goes
wrong."
</p>

<p>
He took her hand and gave it a crunch.
</p>

<p>
"Tuts!" he said.  "I'm no easy to move,
but I like a ploy at a time.  I feel younger
to-night than I've felt this ten years.  He's only
a wee bit German after all."
</p>

<p>
Without another word they reached the Fort,
and Macpherson, who seemed a capable man
though silent as a dyke, passed through the
gateway and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
They skirted the outer rampart noiselessly
and taking up their stand some hundred yards
beyond the entrance gates, awaited the rope.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later and down it came, and
steadying Miss Macpherson for fear she grew
giddy and fell, they began to mount together,
and reached the top.  There all was very dark
and quiet, and the mist obscured everything
outside the reach of a man's arm.
</p>

<p>
The garrison had long since grown careless
now that the Highland forces had been utterly
dispersed and crushed.  Even the Duke was
growing lukewarm in persecution and anxious
to bid farewell to the land of snow and mist and
hear what London had to say to him for his
brave doings.  At that very moment he sat
toasting his toes before a grand peat fire with
a log or two to give it flame, a glass of mulled
wine at his elbow.
</p>

<p>
The room in which he sat was very small and
compact, the shutters drawn, and the seat in
which he dozed one he had procured from
the wreckage of a chief's house&mdash;a massive
cushioned chair&mdash;with a back so high that it
took a big man to see who entered the room.
</p>

<p>
He had dined as well as Highland rations
would permit, and, like all Germans, he loved
his food.  He also relished the hour following
his dinner.  He had a kind of reverence for
that sacred time.
</p>

<p>
To lounge before the fire on that dreary
night of cold rain and mist, a night fit only for
Highland cattle and suchlike, had its
compensations.  The last few months had brought
their burden of anxiety and fatigue.  The eve
of Culloden had been enough to try any man's
nerve.  Had he lost&mdash;had he been taken or
killed&mdash;there is little question that the English
Crown would have changed hands.  Perhaps
he had been over hard on the barbarous people
who had rebelled, but he was frightened.
Looking back on it now, he saw that he had
lost his head for a time.  And now the country
was subdued.  He could return and listen to
the things that London was waiting to say.
There would be flags and banquets and honours.
England was at his feet.  Labour accomplished
successfully has, indeed, its consolations.
</p>

<p>
He stirred the fire and listened to the crackle
of the wood.  It was a fine, brisk, homely
noise on such a wretched night of driving rain
and sleet.  It was good to feel the rare glow
of it on one's feet and knees.  He wondered
why it seemed so much better on a night of
storm.  He hunted in his mind for a reason.
Suddenly he chuckled.  He remembered the
Young Pretender, sheltering for all he knew
under a ledge of dripping rock, or in a byre for
cattle.  Bad weather cut two ways.  It had
its comforts for the victor&mdash;it lashed the fugitive
most piteously.
</p>

<p>
He laughed outright at the notion.  Where
was he now, that silly young man?  Yet not
so young&mdash;his own age in solemn truth.  Then
all the more credit to himself.  Where was he
now, but on some open moor like a curlew in
the night or a stag watching the way he had
run.
</p>

<p>
His eyes shut and suddenly a snore rang
through the firelit room.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment a tall and heavily
plaided figure passed noiselessly across the
space that divided the door from the table
and stood there for a moment as though undecided
in his mind what course to take.  In the
doorway there hung a heavy curtain.  Behind
this there was another form.  One could see
that by the curve of it inside the room.
</p>

<p>
On the table there lay a paper&mdash;a despatch
apparently, and this the man behind the chair
looked at idly with his thoughts upon the silent
figure sunk in slumber.
</p>

<p>
But as he read he frowned, and then, very
softly he gathered up the paper and returned to
the doorway where his companion appeared,
and together they passed out of sight.
</p>

<p>
In an adjoining room they paused, and
together bent over the dispatch.  It was
dated two days since, from Loch Carron, and
signed by Captain Strange.  It stated that
Neil Mackenzie had encountered Muckle John
and Rob Fraser in the inn of Loch Carron,
and in an attempt to capture them had suffered
both in body and reputation, and that unless
he was permitted to take vengeance upon them
he and his following would cease to interest
themselves in the business of the Government
further.  That Neil Mackenzie, himself, was
even now journeying to Fort Augustus to explain
the matter, and that he advised that it might
reflect less on the Government if the affair was
left in Highland hands.  The remainder of the
dispatch dealt with the state of the district,
the capture of Lord Lovat, and concluded
with the words: "There are reasons why it
would be expedient if neither Muckle John or Rob
Fraser stood their trial, but were reduced to silence
by some other course, in fact if your Highness
could see your way to disarming their suspicions
and the suspicions of the Jacobites in some way,
it would leave the road clear for Mackenzie."
</p>

<p>
"This Mackenzie," whispered Miss Macpherson,
"is like to be the end of Rob I'm
thinking.  It is evident that he has suffered at
the hands of Muckle John...."
</p>

<p>
"And means mischief," added Castleleathers.
</p>

<p>
In the room down the passage the snores of
the Duke rolled peacefully on.
</p>

<p>
Miss Macpherson paused, turning the matter
over in her practical mind.
</p>

<p>
"Have you ever seen this Neil Mackenzie?"
she asked at last.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I never had dealings with Mackenzies,"
he replied.
</p>

<p>
"Then why not take his place, my man?
The Duke canna tell one tartan from another.
Hear what he has to say.  Tell him your people
are mortally offended with Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
"But what of Mackenzie himself?"
</p>

<p>
Her face hardened.
</p>

<p>
"Mackenzie must be sent upon his business,"
she said, "and what is more, he must never
reach the Fort."
</p>

<p>
"One ploy at a time," said Castleleathers,
"and here goes for the first."
</p>

<p>
With that he tip-toed back and replaced the
dispatch, then with a heavy tread walked
down the passage, and knocked upon the
door.
</p>

<p>
"Who is there?" cried the Duke starting
from sleep.
</p>

<p>
"Neil Mackenzie, your Highness."
</p>

<p>
Cumberland pushed the chair about.
</p>

<p>
In the room he saw a great man standing
muffled to his face in a plaid.  He had the
bearing of a robber chief, but one never knew
with these terrible Highlanders.
</p>

<p>
"I 'ave 'eard ov you," said the Duke civilly
enough, despite his harsh Teutonic voice, "two
hours since I received a despatch from Captain
Strange referring to some trouble between you
and Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
"My people," said Castleleathers, turning his
face to the shadow, "have received an affront
which can only be wiped out in one way.  We are
prepared to serve the Government with loyalty
and we look to your Highness to remember it."
</p>

<p>
The Duke took up the paper and read it
through very carefully.
</p>

<p>
"Zey are both dangerous Jacobites," he
said, "and there are reasons vy zis Muckle
John should not stand 'is trial in London.  He
knows too much, Mr. Mackenzie.  There are
things we vish to keep to ourselves for a
little&mdash;you understand?"
</p>

<p>
Castleleathers bowed his head.
</p>

<p>
"There is the boy too," he said.
</p>

<p>
Cumberland shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Now that Lovat is taken, I care no dings
for 'im.  But he vill serve to put you on the
trail of the other."
</p>

<p>
"He is elusive, your Highness&mdash;there is no
telling how we can lay hands on him unless..."
</p>

<p>
"Unless what?"
</p>

<p>
"Your Highness could appear to have pity
on his youth and issue a pardon.  It would be
an act of clemency and what followed would
only point to clan jealousy."
</p>

<p>
Cumberland frowned.  He was a straight-forward
man with an aversion for subterfuge.
</p>

<p>
"I do nod like your Highland vays," he
said grumpily, "why not hang the boy in the
ordinary vay?  Muckle John is a different
matter.  I see no reason for this pardon."
</p>

<p>
Castleleathers played his last card.
</p>

<p>
"There are wheels within wheels," said he,
"we know that this Muckle John has pledged
his word to preserve the life of the boy.  When
we have the boy in our hands, for he will come
home on receiving his pardon, we will have the
bait for the catching of Muckle John.  Two
rebels will have gone, your Highness, and
none the wiser.  There are things this Muckle
John could say that would sound badly in a
trial...."
</p>

<p>
"I know, I know," said Cumberland, ill at
ease, "but surely there are odder vays...."
</p>

<p>
Castleleathers shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"It is all we have asked," he said, "and
we are not a small clan."
</p>

<p>
The Duke noted the menace in his voice and
controlled his anger with an effort.
</p>

<p>
"At anodder time," he said, "I would see you
var enough, but I am sick to death of all this
futile business and the wrangles of one clan
with another.  Have it as you will."
</p>

<p>
He strode to the table, took a piece of paper
out of a drawer and began to write upon it.
</p>

<p>
"Here," he said crossly, "is ze pardon for
Rob Fraser, and now let me hear no more of
Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
"Your Highness has acted wisely," said
Castleleathers smoothly, and a minute later
took his leave.
</p>

<p>
Backwards and forwards tramped the Duke
of Cumberland, his thoughts deep again upon his
departure for London and the brave times
ahead.  Forgotten was all the hardship of the
last few months&mdash;the poor fare and dreary
weather.  He was like a man saying a glad
farewell to a desolate country of savages.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"It is but half done," whispered Castleleathers
to Miss Macpherson when they stood once more
upon the heather, "he has forgotten Rob and is
like a man eaten up with longing for the south.
I've seen such before.  There is still Mackenzie.
He may be upon us any minute, and what is it
to be, the sword or a dunt upon the head."
</p>

<p>
"A Mackenzie," remarked Miss Macpherson,
like to overflow with joy at the pardon, "is
neither here nor there, but what of the swarm?
You may kill one bee, but dinna forget the hive."
</p>

<p>
"True," said Castleleathers, "which way
will he come?"
</p>

<p>
"He will come by this very road&mdash;I doubt
but we'll meet him any minute."
</p>

<p>
It was long before they heard the sound of
a horse thudding up the glen, and very soon
the squelch of its feet in the sodden ground.
Instantly they crouched by the way, and then
as the horseman drew level with them they
raised their heads and took him in at a glance.
He was a very heavily built man, muffled up
in a riding cloak and with a bonnet upon his
head.
</p>

<p>
"A Mackenzie if ever there was one,"
whispered Castleleathers, and starting up came
upon him from the slope of the hill and hauled
him off his beast so that he uttered one startled
cry and sprawled in the heather with his legs in
the air.  In the same grim silence, Castleleathers
was upon his chest and with a dirk
at his throat.
</p>

<p>
"Is it to be the quick passage," he whispered
in Gaelic, "or do you swear to do what is said?"
</p>

<p>
There was a long silence.
</p>

<p>
Mackenzie upon his back and helpless as a
child was trying to see the tartan of the man
above him.
</p>

<p>
"Neil Mackenzie," said Castleleathers, "unless
you forget what brought you here this night,
you are not like to remember it at all."
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" gasped Mackenzie, trying
to see the better.
</p>

<p>
"I," replied Castleleathers, "am Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
"Muckle John?"  He doubted it, but it was
black darkness where they lay amongst the
heather.
</p>

<p>
"What of the affair Loch Carron way?"
continued Castleleathers.  "You came poorly
enough out of that.  But I have a mind to end
it this time.  I am not a patient man and no
one has dealings against me who does not at last
regret it."
</p>

<p>
"I will go back," said Mackenzie in a heavy
tone like a man beaten once and for all.
</p>

<p>
"You must tell your people that you are
satisfied with the answer the Duke has given you."
</p>

<p>
"I will&mdash;I swear it!"
</p>

<p>
Castleleathers drew back and leaped to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Away then!" he said, "the road to the
west lies clear.  But if you so much as dream
of treachery&mdash;-no power can save you."
</p>

<p>
In silence Mackenzie caught his horse and
mounting it took the road for home, all the
courage gone out of him.  All that night he
rode, and the next day, and when he reached
Loch Carron he gave no word at all, but bore the
aspect of a man who fears to look over his
shoulder in the gloaming.
</p>

<p>
As for Castleleathers and Miss Macpherson,
being both people over middle life, they made
their way stiffly homewards to an inn near
Fort Augustus.
</p>

<p>
It was over a basin of hot brose that he
turned to her.
</p>

<p>
"I am past ploys like these," he said, "but it
smacks of the old days."
</p>

<p>
"The young ones are no like the old ones,"
sighed Miss Macpherson.
</p>

<p>
"None so old," rejoined Castleleathers, smiling
at her suddenly.
</p>

<p>
Miss Macpherson busied herself with her plate.
</p>

<p>
"It's after Rob we must go the morn," she said.
</p>

<p>
"It has been a great night," he remarked,
nodding before the fire, "that Mackenzie was
sair taken aback."
</p>

<p>
"The Duke is no sae difficult to manage as
folk say," hazarded Miss Macpherson.
</p>

<p>
"Young blood," grunted Castleleathers, "he
only needs managing."
</p>

<p>
"You're all the same," murmured Miss
Macpherson slyly.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br><br>
THE HOUSE OF THE FOUR MEN
</h3>

<p>
Of the travelling of Rob to the south there is
little enough to tell until he reached Rannoch,
the country of Robertsons and Stewarts, and
other clans more like to pick a pocket than to
cry God-speed.
</p>

<p>
On the evening following the departure of
Muckle John, Rob had bartered with a pedlar
upon the road for a suit of old clothes, and too
fearful of the future to refuse the exorbitant
price demanded, he gave him some silver and
buried his kilt in a mountain pool.
</p>

<p>
And so, with more confidence, he stepped out
towards the south, and reached Loch Linnhe
without misadventure.  It was his intention
to avoid all the district about Fort William by
taking boat to the other side.
</p>

<p>
In this manner he passed through Glencoe and
travelling by day, reached the head of Loch
Rannoch in a dusk of drizzling rain.
</p>

<p>
Now the country that includes Rannoch,
Lochaber and Breadalbane had no rival for
insubordination in those days.  It swarmed
with broken men&mdash;cattle thieves and desperadoes
of all kinds owning fealty to none but their
own good pleasure, and only Jacobite so far
as it was politic to be, and with an unsleeping
eye to the plunder of the Lowlands.
</p>

<p>
It was with anxious steps, therefore, that
Rob approached a solitary huddle of buildings
lying in a snug hollow of the hills, thatched to
the colour of the brown trees, with here and
there a patch of young heather over the top of it.
It was strangely hidden and quiet, with all the
look of an old inn fallen on evil days.
</p>

<p>
For long Rob stared at it with dubious eyes;
there was so little life about it, and so much that
was mysteriously ominous.  Though drenched
with the thin hill rain, craving for food and
shelter, he was in a half mind to continue his
way, when the face of a man looked through
the small hole in the side that served for a
window&mdash;a green-white face it was, with staring
unwavering eyes.
</p>

<p>
But where there was a living soul there would
be food and shelter and Rob stepped forward,
forgetting his secret fear.  Inside the place,
however, there was no sound, but only the
monotonous dripping of water upon the muddy
floor.  In the centre of the room there hung
a great pot upon a chain from the roof, and
the place was so full of peat reek that it took
him a few minutes to see where the man had gone.
</p>

<p>
Against the wall were layers of rushes, and
a narrow stairway led up to a kind of loft about
six feet above the floor.  Under the loft were
the cows.  He could hear them coughing
fitfully through the wooden partition.
</p>

<p>
It was a poor enough place and leaking from
a score of holes, but it was warm, and so
tired was he that he sat down before the peats
and warmed his hands.
</p>

<p>
Presently the door opened and the man
re-entered.  Rob wondered how he had managed
to come that way.  He started when he saw
Rob, but wished him good-day civilly
enough and inquired if he could provide him
with anything.  He was a sallow, secretive
looking fellow, with a tangled beard and hair
and a terrible squint.
</p>

<p>
"You are passing south maybe," he said,
busying himself about the place.
</p>

<p>
With some uneasiness Rob replied that he
was journeying to Edinburgh seeking employment.
</p>

<p>
"It is a Stewart you will be?" remarked
the man, squinting terribly.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Rob, "I am a Fraser."
</p>

<p>
"A Fraser," he echoed, "I take it you can
pay your way."
</p>

<p>
"I can that," said Rob with some indignation
for fear he should be sent back into the rain,
and with a foolish notion that the man might
be of assistance he drew out a dozen silver
coins and clinked them in his open hand.
</p>

<p>
In the blue smoke of the place the man
paused.  He stood perfectly still with his ghastly
squint accentuated.  Then putting some meat
into the pot he set the lid on, and going to the
door spoke to some one outside.  This he did
so casually that Rob suspected nothing, but sat
dozing before the warm glow, utterly spent and
stupid with fatigue.
</p>

<p>
It must have been about eight of the clock
that he finished his supper, and asked to be
shown to a place to sleep.  This the innkeeper
did very readily, lighting him up the narrow
stairway into the loft and pointing to a heap
of dry heather in a corner.  Out in the
night the rain was falling dismally and below
him Rob could hear the warm and comfortable
breathing of the cows.  Yet, tired
though he was, a curious dread of falling asleep
came on him.  There was something about
the place that set his nerves on edge.  Was
it the eerie silence of it&mdash;lost amongst the
lonely elbow of the loch?  But that was nothing
new to him.  Was it the strange catlike movements
of the man with the squint?  But he was
probably a decent enough creature unused
to strangers.  Or was there danger lurking in
the place, memories of dreadful things done
there in the black darkness?  His hand
instinctively sought the dirk at his side.
</p>

<p>
<i>It was gone</i>!
</p>

<p>
In an instant he was upon his feet.  Whether
the man below had stolen it or not he dare
not take the risk of staying in that lonely place
unarmed.  He must make his way into the
night and trust to fortune that he would evade
pursuit should there be any.
</p>

<p>
Very softly he felt his way about, hunting
for a window or trapdoor.  But there was no
way of escape.  Under the door leading to the
stairway shone a rim of light thrown up by
the peat fire below, and in one place where the
wood had been eaten by mice there was a round
hole large enough to command the room beneath.
He lay at his length and peered down.
</p>

<p>
To his horror there were four men gathered
about the fire&mdash;the innkeeper and three ragged,
crouching figures, with cruelty and murder
written all over their faces.  They were dressed
in a tartan so filthy and stained with rain and
mud that Rob was ignorant of their clan.  They
were shaggy as cattle beasts, dirty, smoke-blackened
fellows, below the average size, active
as wild cats, and chattering in whispers like
a crew of unwashed monkeys.  Even in the
remnants of the Chevalier's army Rob had not
encountered such as these.  Only in Lochaber
and Rannoch could such scourings of the clans
be found until one met the red Macgregors
which Providence forfend.
</p>

<p>
The innkeeper had his back turned to the
stairway, but by the motion of his hands Rob
read what he said like an open page.  He was
telling them of the silver that he, in his rashness,
had exposed.
</p>

<p>
In the red firelight Rob could see their eyes
gleam beneath their matted hair.  With hypnotized
gaze he watched a man unsheath his dirk
and make a gesture significant enough, and with
a gurgle in the throat requiring no explanation.
So that was to be the end of it all&mdash;a secret
murder by a band of lawless caterans ready to
prey upon every stranger luckless enough to
beg a night's lodging.  He would never see
Muckle John again.  It made him wonder
what he would have done to save his life.  Muckle
John always had a way.
</p>

<br>
HE WATCHED ONE OF THE MEN UNSHEATH HIS DIRK <br>
AND MAKE A GESTURE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH.
</p>

<p>
Down below the men had risen to their feet.
He saw them standing in their own steam,
their heads close together, and their beards
wagging as they whispered.  Then one by one
they approached the stairway.  A wild terror
seized him at that.  The soft pat of their
brogues upon the rungs of the ladder and the
creak of it under their weight was like to make
him scream.
</p>

<p>
Starting back he stood upon the trap door in
the empty hope that they would not be able
to lift it.  A moment, and he felt it give a faint
heave under him.  It was delivered gently, as
though the man on the ladder suspected it
would be stiff or difficult to push back.
</p>

<p>
And then there was absolute silence.
</p>

<p>
Did they suspect that he was awake?  Rob
listened intently.  But what he heard was the
innkeeper softly ordering them back, and at
that moment there sounded outside in the night
a man's voice calling.
</p>

<p>
Once more Rob lay upon the floor and peered
below.  Around the fire the men were sitting as
before.  In the doorway the innkeeper was
standing with the firelight upon his back.
Outside there was the humid noise of a horse
losing its hold in sopping ground, and again a
voice called&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Can you give me shelter?"
</p>

<p>
With a backward glance the innkeeper disappeared,
leaving those crouching figures utterly
silent.  To Rob a wild flash of hope flamed
suddenly.  Who could say but this might be a
friend in distress?
</p>

<p>
He heard the innkeeper open the door in the
byre below him and stall the horse; but he
never moved in his eagerness to watch who
should enter the place.  Suddenly a man looked
in at the group about the fire, and hesitated as
though he wished himself back upon the road.
Then, entering, he drew off his cloak.
</p>

<p>
It was John Murray of Broughton.
</p>

<p>
The three men round the fire made no motion,
threatening or otherwise.  They crouched on
their haunches as before, watching him under
their shaggy eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
Murray, who was no coward in ordinary circumstances,
but only highly strung and with the Lowland
caution, stood out of their range obviously
ill at ease, awaiting the innkeeper's return.
</p>

<p>
To Rob he looked very worn and hollow-cheeked
and his clothes cheap and ill-fitting
like the dress of a small Ayrshire farmer.  A
sword was at his side and there was a bulge in
his coat-pocket like the butt end of a pistol,
but Rob took little comfort from that, knowing
how poor a defence a single man like Murray
would put up under a swift attack.
</p>

<p>
The innkeeper re-entered the room and,
shutting the door, barred it across with a heavy
slab of wood.  For weal or woe they were there
till morning.
</p>

<p>
He motioned Murray forward saying nothing,
and the men about the fire made room for
him, watching him all the time as dogs eye
a stranger, ready at a word to fling
themselves upon his throat.
</p>

<p>
Murray hesitated before he sat down and
cast one fleeting glance about the room.  A
sudden inclination came to Rob to shout a
warning and leap down to join him before it
was too late.  But he knew that they would
complete their evil work before even he could
take a part.
</p>

<p>
The innkeeper stirred the iron pot and drew
out a hank of meat upon a dirk.  This he handed
to Murray, who took it in a dejected fashion
and began to eat, and very quietly, while
Rob watched him in a stupor of horror, he
stepped behind him.  But he made no attack.
Instead he shook his head at the others and
jerked a thumb towards the room where Rob
lay watching them.  They evidently purposed
to kill them both at one and the same time.
</p>

<p>
Underneath him the horse coughed and
rattled its bit.  Only an inch or two of wood
between him and safety&mdash;only a thin decayed
layer of wood.  A rat was gnawing in a far corner;
he heard it squeak in the darkness.  Down below
they were sitting quite speechless about the
fire, waiting for the newcomer to seek his sleep.
Murray was white and brooding, knowing no
Gaelic, certain that danger was all about him,
nodding with weariness and ever pulling up
for dread of what was biding its time to strike.
In haste Rob examined the flooring of the
loft.  His fingers ran along the fringes of the
boards.  No flaw, no splintered grain, no crumbling
of worm-eaten plank.  Still the rat gnawed
with steady persistence in the far corner.
Perhaps there was a way there.  He groped
about, and his hands encountered a sack propped
up against the wall.  It was very heavy but
he moved it gradually.  The rat scuttled away
and dropped out of the room.  He heard it fall
upon the soft mud below, and into his face
there rose the warm smell of cows.
</p>

<p>
Breathlessly he examined the flooring behind
the sack, and at the corner where the thing had
stood his hands groped in vacancy.  There was
a hole a foot in breadth.  Without delay he
gripped the frayed edge, where the rat had
gnawed, in his strong muscular fingers and,
setting his feet against the wall opposite him,
strained to his fullest power.
</p>

<p>
With a sharp crack it broke away&mdash;a good two
feet.  Underneath the horse snorted with sudden
fear; it seemed to be only a few inches beneath
his hand.  Lying full length, he stretched down
into the pitch darkness and touched its ear,
soothing it with a whisper.
</p>

<p>
The way lay clear.
</p>

<p>
Then, regaining his feet, he stole back to
the other end of the place and looked down
upon the men below.  It was a curious, somewhat
pathetic sight that met his eyes.  Murray
was upon his feet and bidding them good night.
He looked as though he knew in his heart
what deed they intended, and was on the point of
appealing to their chivalry (if they had any),
and yet too proud to do so.  In the end
he only bowed and, taking a rushlight from
the innkeeper, climbed slowly up the stairway
and lifted the trap-door.
</p>

<p>
Now it was evident to Rob that if Murray,
unnerved by illness and fatigue came upon
him suddenly, he might hesitate or utter a cry,
and for this reason he hid himself behind the
sack until he was in the room and the trap-door
shut, when he whispered, "Mr. Murray,
Mr. Murray," as gently as he could.
</p>

<p>
There was a sharp sound like a gasp, and
Murray replied in the same tone, "Who is it?"
</p>

<p>
With his finger on his lips, Rob appeared
before him.
</p>

<p>
"Quick!" he whispered, "lift the sack with
me and put it upon the trap-door.  It will
serve for a few minutes.  They are cut-throats
down there."
</p>

<p>
For an instant Murray fumbled with his
sword and then, controlling himself, he aided
Rob, though his strength was not of much value
at such a time.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for them, the four men below
were hard at it together, whispering in Gaelic,
and evidently in high feather over the business
ahead, so that they did not hear the moving
of the sack.  That accomplished, Rob drew
Murray to the far corner.
</p>

<p>
"Your horse is below," he said; "drop down
and soothe him while I wait in case they come.
Give me your sword.  Lead him out upon the
road and I'll join you there."
</p>

<p>
It was strange to take orders from a boy, but
Murray had no option in such circumstances.
He was no Highlander and had no foolish pride.
Without a word, he slipped into the blackness
of the stall, and Rob heard him patting his
beast and turning it towards the door.
</p>

<p>
At that same moment however there came
a noise at the sack that sent Rob across the
floor with the naked sword-blade in his hand.
</p>

<p>
The trap-door lifted very slowly; a hand
crept under its ledge and gripped the rough
boarding a few inches from Rob.  There was
not a moment to delay.  Falling upon his knees,
he lunged into the darkness below.  Instantly
there rose a most horrible cry, something fell
with a dull thud, and the trap-door banged upon
the blade shivering it from the hilt downwards.
</p>

<p>
For his folly Rob was defenceless again.
</p>

<p>
But there was far worse to come, for at the
noise of that terrible stricken voice there came
a wild plunging of a horse outside and the dying
thud of feet.  Murray of Broughton was gone.
Perhaps his beast bolted with terror; perhaps
he waited and dreaded that Rob was killed&mdash;who
can tell?  He was of all men least able to
endure suspense.
</p>

<p>
At that calamity there came to Rob a wild
terror of the place and a panic to be gone.
He reached the hole in the corner and dropped
down upon the mud below.  The fresh rain was
blowing in upon his face from the open doorway
where Murray had passed.  He was out in it
with a rush and into the friendly darkness,
where he halted.
</p>

<p>
No movement came from the lonely inn&mdash;no
cries or noise of any kind, only a brooding,
death-like quiet as though the place were
uninhabited or thronged with ghosts.  In a kind of
ghastly horror, he hesitated and then stole
back, overcome by a curiosity too overwhelming
to be crushed.  Back he came and peered into
the byre.  But there was no sound&mdash;not even
a rat gnawing at the wood.  It was cold and
forsaken.  He crept round the outer wall, safe
in the night whatever might occur, and stared
at the black door where he had entered at the
dusk, seeing no gleaming firelight on the wall.
</p>

<p>
The rain had stopped of a sudden, and a faint
glimmer of starlight showed in the doorway
black and void.  There was no door but only a
huddle of stones.  Nearer he crept, until at last
he could look into the room itself.
</p>

<p>
And at that he took to his heels and ran
blindly into the night&mdash;anywhere so long as he
was well away from that grim and desolate
house.
</p>

<p>
For in the room there was no fire, no staircase
nor any sign of living soul.  Nothing but
an empty, roofless ruin under the open sky.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br><br>
THE END OF A TALE
</h3>

<p>
All that weeping night of rain Rob travelled
towards Glen Lyon glad for every foot of heather
between him and the weird house upon the loch.
Passing through the country of the Mackenzies
he reached Killin, and there fell in with a band
of gipsies sitting round their camp fire.  They
numbered about a score&mdash;men, women, and
little brown children&mdash;and they welcomed him
to share their meat in the kindliest manner,
asking no questions and displaying no curiosity
in his affairs.  Only the chief knew Gaelic, and
he was all the more ready to hear the news of
the north from Rob, who gathered that his
affection for the red-coats was by no means warm.
</p>

<p>
Rob accepted his kindness with a qualm of
self reproach.  It had suddenly occurred to him
that in accepting such a wealth of hospitality he
was endangering them to the vengeance of the
Government.  Such a prospect was not to be
contemplated.
</p>

<p>
"Let me speak to you alone," he said to the chief.
</p>

<p>
In the privacy of the tent he told him all.
</p>

<p>
"I will not attempt to deny," said he, "that
there are those who would give much to capture
me, not for any importance I may have, but
because of another...."
</p>

<p>
The gipsy followed his words with expressionless
attention.  Then rising he drew a paper from
his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Read," he said simply.
</p>

<p>
It was a Government notice for posting up
under gibbets and suchlike, intimating that anyone
who laid one, Rob Fraser, by the heels, dead
or alive, would receive a reward of fifty pounds.
Rob turned cold at the dreadful wording of
it.  It described him minutely, and went on
to say that he was last seen with the notorious
rebel called "Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
"You knew?" said he at last.
</p>

<p>
The other laughed softly.
</p>

<p>
"What does it matter?" he replied, "but
I thank you for your confidence, and when next
you see Muckle John say that Gloom the Gipsy
has not forgotten him."
</p>

<p>
"Are you a friend of Muckle John?"
</p>

<p>
"I may be counted such, though he has no
lack of friends&mdash;or enemies."
</p>

<p>
"But I cannot imperil your people, it is
more than is reasonable."
</p>

<p>
"Rob Fraser," said Gloom very gravely,
"you are as good as taken.  The soldiers are
watching for you on the Highland Line, and
from here to Stirling is alive with spies.
To-morrow we will carry you through Balquhidder,
for if you fell foul of the wild caterans there
it would be a short shift for you."
</p>

<p>
"Balquhidder&mdash;I have heard the name...."
</p>

<p>
He laughed outright at that.
</p>

<p>
"It's clear ye are north country bred," he
said, "there are more thieves Balquhidder way
than in Lochaber itself."
</p>

<p>
Thankful indeed for his good fortune Rob
bade his friend good-night, and lying down
before the fire was soon fast asleep.
</p>

<p>
With the dawn they were marching towards
Crianlarich where they took to the heather, and
crossing the hills came down upon Loch Doine
at the head of Balquhidder.  As they streamed
into the flat country at the top of the loch they
passed a square thatched house at the foot of
the slope facing the amber stream.
</p>

<p>
"That is Inverlochlarig where Rob Roy
died," said Gloom.  "I mind him well, a great
red man with a heart of gold.  But his sons are
corbies, and I am hoping we do not meet them."
</p>

<p>
All up the side of the stream the cottages of
the Macgregors clustered, with the thin veil
of peat reek hanging above them in a kind of haze.
</p>

<p>
Without halting they passed over the flat
marshy land that lay between the two ranges
of mountain, and approached a small compactly
built house upon the other side of the burn.
</p>

<p>
"We will stop here for the night," said Gloom,
"and maybe Invernenty will see us.  He is no
friend of the Macgregors, being son of John
Maclaren who was murdered by Robin Oig."
</p>

<p>
Leaving Rob he crossed the narrow stream
and knocking upon the door exchanged some
words with a woman who opened it.  But to
all that he said she only shook her head, and
he returned somewhat discomfited.
</p>

<p>
"She says that Invernenty is not at home,"
he said, calling him by the name of his place,
"and yet I am doubting her unless he is taken."
</p>

<p>
Without delay they set their camp, and during
the day several Macgregors came over and eyed
them secretly, red men in a red tartan&mdash;querulous,
hot-blooded fellows.
</p>

<p>
Rob, ill at ease in a strange country, kept in
the background, but in the afternoon seeing a
great crowd of them gathered about a place up
the glen he accompanied Gloom, being wearied
of sitting alone.
</p>

<p>
The Macgregors with a sprinkling of Maclarens
were handling a curious smooth stone with holes
for a finger and a thumb, and competing with
one another in lifting it upon a small rock that
stood in close proximity.
</p>

<p>
A tall dark sombre-looking man leaning upon
a rude crutch and with a pale harassed face was
regarding the scene from a little distance.  He
was dressed in riding clothes and with a greatcoat
buttoned up closely as though he were ill.
Rob was on the point of asking who he was
when he became aware of the other's close
scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
There was something dangerously interested
in the manner he stared&mdash;taking him in with
his dark cunning eyes, measuring his height in
his mind&mdash;the set of his face, conjuring up every
detail circumspectly.
</p>

<p>
"Gloom," said Rob in a whisper, "there's a
man up on the brae has a notion who I am."
</p>

<p>
Very casually the gipsy turned about.
</p>

<p>
"Misfortune take it," he murmured, "but it
is James More, son of Rob Roy, new come from
Culloden.  He was wounded, ye mind."
</p>

<p>
Presently without a word or any sign James
Macgregor moved painfully away and entered
Inverlochlarig.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Rob," said Gloom, "I would not
trust that man a foot.  He is up to mischief,
and it's like enough we were better over
Glenbucket than here."
</p>

<p>
Evening drew on, but there was no sign of
trouble.  At the rising of the moon, however,
a tall gaunt woman with a plaid over her head
asked for a word with the gipsy.  They went
apart together and conferred in low tones.  And
then as silently as she had come the woman
vanished into the shadows.
</p>

<p>
"Rob," said Gloom, "there's danger threatening&mdash;when
was there not in this wild country?
Who do you think that was?"
</p>

<p>
Rob shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Who but John Maclaren himself, new come
from giving the red-coats the go-bye on the road
to Carlisle.  He says James is up to his pranks,
and that the clan are scared to death at the very
sight of you in the heart of their country.  It is
away we must go, Rob," and summoning his
men they prepared to set out, leaving their camp
fires burning in case their flight was suspected.
Over the cleft in the hills they went, and crossing
the top of Beinn-an-Shithein, came down
on Strathyre and Castle Murdoch.
</p>

<p>
"There is a strange man lives there," said
the gipsy to Rob, "it's like enough he will send
us about our business should we stop."
</p>

<p>
"Who are ye?" snarled a voice at that
moment from the wall of the place, "ye canna
bide hereabouts."
</p>

<p>
The moon had risen and under its clear rays
Rob looked up and saw a white-haired man
watching them from the rampart.
</p>

<p>
"What kind of night skulking is this?" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"I am Gloom," replied the gipsy.
</p>

<p>
"And who is that with you, he is none of your
people."
</p>

<p>
"He is a friend, Murdoch."
</p>

<p>
"Bring him here&mdash;this is an ill time for
friends," and he disappeared.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later they saw him crossing
the courtyard, a lamp swinging in his hand,
limping through a shortness of his right leg, and
frowning at them as he peered through the
shattered iron gates.
</p>

<p>
"Come nearer," he rasped, "you boy there
with the borrowed claes."
</p>

<p>
Rob took a step towards him so that the light
streamed down upon his features.
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" grunted Murdoch, cocking his
eyes at the gipsy, "it is queer company ye're
taken up with, my man.  Do ye ken who that
is with his innocent face and braw blue eyes?
That's the lad of Muckle John."
</p>

<p>
"Whist!" warned Gloom, "the very rocks
have ears."
</p>

<p>
At that moment a little girl came running
over the courtyard.
</p>

<p>
"What did ye say of Muckle John?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Gang to your bed, Ethlenn," screamed the
old man.  "Janet, away with the bairn."
</p>

<p>
A woman ran out into the twilight.  There
was a noise of sudden crying and a door banged.
</p>

<p>
"Can we bide the night here?" asked the
gipsy, but with poor enough heart in it.
</p>

<p>
"Bide the night," echoed Murdoch sharply,
"bide the night in company with yon?  Can
ye&mdash;by the dogs of Lorn I think ye're crazed.
What have I ever done to ye that ye should
mak' me sic a daft-like proposal?"
</p>

<p>
"It is no use, Rob," said Gloom sadly.
</p>

<p>
With a kind of horror at his own notoriety
Rob turned away and passed down the slope.
He heard the voice of Murdoch raised in shrill
anger and falling into nothingness on the wind.
Behind him trooped the gipsies, uncomplaining
but dispirited, streaming towards Strathyre.
</p>

<p>
And so passing through the sleeping village
they reached the narrow defile at the head of
Loch Lubnaig, and ascending the hillside passed
a dreary night.
</p>

<p>
It was just before the dawn of the next day
that Rob came to a decision, which appeared
to him the only wise and honest thing to do.
He wrote a brief note to Gloom thanking him
for his great kindness, and stating that he would
be far towards the south by the morning.
</p>

<p>
Then stepping between the gipsies' sleeping
forms he came down upon the loch and set off
at a trot for Kilmahog.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Many days afterwards&mdash;days full to the brim
of danger and heavy travelling, Rob reached
Edinburgh and wandered about the High Street.
He had managed to purchase another set of
clothes, and for the present he deemed himself
safe, and on the morrow he would keep his tryst
with Muckle John at Leith.
</p>

<p>
It was about midday that he saw a great
coach lumbering over the rude cobbles jolting
and groaning, and about it a party of dragoons.
A sudden fear gripped him that perchance this
was a prisoner, who knew&mdash;perhaps Muckle
John himself.
</p>

<p>
He pushed his way to the front of the crowd.
Nearer clattered the dragoons, a braver sight
than when they had entered that same street
in the year '45.  The horses straining at the
coach were level with him now, and he bent
forward, his eyes glued to the window.  It was
but a flash, but he never forgot it.
</p>

<p>
For lolling forward, leering grotesquely either
in derision or some kindred emotion, sat Simon,
Lord Lovat, bound for London and Tower Hill.
</p>

<p>
His small shrewd eyes travelling over the
crowd settled for an instant upon Rob, and
contracted suddenly as though he half recollected
him, but was not sure.  Then he was gone, and
that was the last of the Fraser.
</p>

<p>
The scene sobered what little foolhardiness
there was left in Rob.  It made him walk less
abroad.  The arm of the law was long, but the
arm of the Government was longer.
</p>

<p>
More than once he had a curious intuition
on that afternoon that he was being followed.
It might be only an accident, but he had run
into two slouching frowsy rascals on two separate
occasions, and each time they had stared very
hard and looked back at him over their shoulders.
</p>

<p>
At last overcome by fear of capture he had
taken to his heels and run up one close and down
another, being quite unfamiliar with the City,
but only anxious to shake off any shadowing.
After he had doubled and dodged for a full
half-hour he took cover upon an ancient stairway
beside the White Horse Inn, and there he waited
to see what would happen and whether there
were really any upon his trail.  It was about
five minutes later that the noise of a man panting
up the lane set him keeking down to see who
came so hastily.  To his dismay it was one of
the loafers of the afternoon, and hard on his heels
the other.  They passed at a run and their
footsteps died away.
</p>

<p>
Then speeding in the opposite direction Rob
found a lodging in another inn, and slept far
into the following day&mdash;the day on which he
was to meet Muckle John and win to freedom
at last.  After all the turmoil and distress of the
weeks following Culloden, it was a strange enough
sensation to think of the great towns ahead in
Holland or France, where there was no dire
necessity to keep one eye over your shoulder
and the other cocked upon the end of the street,
and where a Jacobite was not considered food
for the nearest gallows tree.
</p>

<p>
So thinking (and yet with misgiving for all
that) Rob passed cannily out of Edinburgh and
along the way to Leith, and again the dread
fear that he was being followed took possession
of him.  The sun was falling when he saw the
lonesome gibbet tree stuck up against the
skyline.  On it the body of some luckless creature
was swinging in its chains&mdash;he could just catch
the dreary creaking on the wind.
</p>

<p>
He looked backward for the twentieth time.
But all the desolate landscape seemed empty
of living soul or beast.
</p>

<p>
And yet he could have sworn that he had seen
a head dodge behind the tussock of coarse rank
grass just on the top of the mound.  He was
so sure of it he ran back, but when he reached
it there was nothing.  Then bending as a true
hillsman reads the ground he saw the fresh mark
of a boot in the wet sand.
</p>

<p>
There was danger lurking amongst the dunes,
and still no sign of Muckle John.
</p>

<p>
Out on the Firth of Forth a ship was running
up her canvas to the breeze, and it set him
wondering in an idle fashion whether Muckle John
might not be already aboard starting for France.
</p>

<p>
And then the sunlight faded and the greyness
of the gloaming crept up from the sea.
</p>

<p>
Clink, clink, went the chains upon the forlorn
gibbet tree, and with a deeper rustier note as
the wood groaned and shuddered in its joints.
</p>

<p>
He walked slowly up the sloping sandy path.
Above him, black above the evening sky swung
the dead man&mdash;some poor soul less guilty of
wrong maybe than he himself.
</p>

<p>
Then sitting upon a heap of sand beside the
dreary burden with its dismal refrain he waited
for what might befall.  That there was danger
afoot he knew instinctively, but his great reliance
upon Muckle John seemed to almost dissipate
such perils.  There was a mountain of strength
in Muckle John.
</p>

<p>
The darkness was falling fast when of a sudden,
like the spring of a leopard for swiftness, a man
was upon his back and with the crook of his
arm around his throat.  Uttering one faint cry
Rob tumbled backwards, and before he could
struggle to his feet, his legs were gripped by
another man and a third flung himself bodily
upon his chest.
</p>

<p>
As far as Rob was concerned the question of
France was over and done with.  It was a sad
enough ending to all his brave adventures to be
bowled over by three vagabonds on Leith sands,
and trussed like a hen.
</p>

<p>
But there was more in it than that.
</p>

<p>
For out of the twilight came a tall man walking
at his leisure, and even before he spoke Rob
knew him for Captain Strange.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said quietly, "so this is the end,
Rob, and what a braw place to be sure.  It was
almost tempting providence with that clinking
cratur to warn ye."
</p>

<p>
He motioned to the men to leave them, and
sitting down began to talk in an affable pleasant
manner as though he were discussing the weather
or the price of stocks.
</p>

<p>
"Hark ye, Rob," he said, "I ken fine who
ye're waiting for.  It's Muckle John no less,
and what I have in my mind I must say quickly.
Now we want this little business carried through
expeditiously and with discretion.  We do not
want any pranks, mind ye, and ye ken Muckle
John as a man as full of tricks as a monkey.  I
want ye to sit here, Rob, until he comes, and
promise me no to say a word to set him thinking.
If ye carry this out I will say what I can for you
when the time comes."
</p>

<p>
"I will shout a warning while I have breath
in my body," cried Rob.
</p>

<p>
"Very good," replied Strange, "very good;
in that case I will gag you surely enough, and
here goes."
</p>

<p>
With that he stuffed a pad of cloth into his
mouth and fastened a bandage round his cheeks.
Then springing to his feet he listened intently.
Very faintly the sound of whistling drifted up
from the sands.  Up above the gibbet chains
creaked to and fro, and in the tragic silence of
the twilight the man came trudging to his doom.
</p>

<p>
Strange darted into the dunes for his men: It
was like to go hard with Muckle John.
</p>

<p>
It was all over as the newcomer stooped over
Rob.  With a muffled shout he fell and rose
again, and writhing spasmodically was stunned
to silence.  From the size of him Rob knew it
could be none other than Muckle John.
</p>

<p>
"A light!" cried Strange, in high glee over
it all.
</p>

<p>
They swung a lantern nearer and turned
their prisoner over upon his back.
</p>

<p>
And there, glaring up at them with apoplectic
rage lay James Fraser of Castleleathers.  It
was a moment full of gall for Strange.
</p>

<p>
As for Castleleathers, worthy man, being
much bruised and scratched and with a bump
like an egg on his head, it was a mercy that he
had no breath to express his feelings on the
matter.  But when he did he only added to
Strange's mortification.  For on hearing of the
plan to capture Muckle John which (being a
professed Hanoverian) he could not criticize
adversely, he expressed a deep regret that he
had not beguiled the rebel with his conversation,
having met him upon the road a mile back.
</p>

<p>
"A mile back," cried Strange, "then he will
come here yet."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Castleleathers in his methodical
tone, "no, I think not, for he has boarded a ship
for France."
</p>

<p>
Strange uttered an exclamation of disgust.
</p>

<p>
"I told you he would throw you over, Rob,
when the time came," said he with a sour look.
</p>

<p>
Certainly it appeared like it.
</p>

<p>
But Castleleathers had more to say.
</p>

<p>
"Will you give me a hearin'," he broke in
peevishly.  "Muckle John would have come, but
I counselled him not."
</p>

<p>
"You did?" screamed Strange.  "But this
is open treason, Major Fraser."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Castleleathers stoutly, "oh no,
I assure you there is no more loyal servant of
the King than I.  But I saw no service that he
could render Rob, except to endanger him as
an associate of a notorious Jacobite."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," said Strange, "but Rob is none
so far removed from that himsel'.  He is like
enough to take the place of the hanged one above
ye, Major Fraser."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, no," replied Castleleathers
blandly, "here I have a pardon for Rob signed
by the Duke himsel'."
</p>

<p>
"It's a forgery," cried Strange hotly, "let
me see it."
</p>

<p>
"In my hands, Captain Strange&mdash;no, stand
back a wee&mdash;hold the light higher, now can ye
see?  Will you dispute that, my man?  There
is his royal signature, bless him!"
</p>

<p>
Strange eyed it gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"There is something queer about this," he
said.  "I will see the Duke."
</p>

<p>
Castleleathers smiled.
</p>

<p>
"All the way to London?" he asked.  "The
Duke will not thank ye."
</p>

<p>
Over their heads the haunted chains jingled
merrily.  It must have been a rare joke to send
them clinking like that.  Suddenly from the ends
of nowhere there was a sound like a smothered
laugh.
</p>

<p>
"What was that?" whispered Strange, looking
furtively about.
</p>

<p>
"I heard nothing," replied Castleleathers,
then starting to his feet, "but surely there is
the noise of a horse."
</p>

<p>
"A horse," said Strange, "who knows it may
be Muckle John himself."
</p>

<p>
"No," corrected Castleleathers composedly,
"no, I think not.  I think&mdash;in fact I am
sure&mdash;it is my wife."
</p>

<p>
"Your wife!" cried Rob, who had worked
the gag out at last, and who had been apparently
overlooked in the discussion.
</p>

<p>
Castleleathers switched about.
</p>

<p>
"Bless us," he said, "I had clean forgotten
ye, Rob, you were so quiet.  What's amiss with
you?"
</p>

<p>
"I am bound hand and foot."
</p>

<p>
"Mercy me," said Castleleathers, "but you
have a queer way with you, Captain Strange.
There ye are, Rob," and he set him free, "and
now what's there so wonderful in my having a
wife?  She's your ain aunt Macpherson.  It's
my nephew ye are, Rob, and if I ever hear of
this Jacobite business again I'll skelp ye mair
than she ever did, poor woman."
</p>

<p>
It was indeed Miss Macpherson (or rather
Mrs. James Fraser of Castleleathers), and at the
sight of her Strange bowed very coldly,
remembering the escape from Fort Augustus, and
calling his men disappeared towards Edinburgh.
</p>

<p>
"Sit ye doon a moment," said Castleleathers,
"though it's a dreary enough place for family
reunions."
</p>

<p>
But Rob only stared out to sea where the
moon was pouring a broad pathway of silver
upon the quivering water.
</p>

<p>
"Did Muckle John not give ye a message for
me?" he asked.  "It will be long ere we
see him again."
</p>

<p>
Castleleathers took a keek over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"To be honest, Rob," he said, "I never saw
him at all.  Maybe he's coming or maybe he is
no sae far off as ye think."
</p>

<p>
"He was the queer yin," remarked Mrs. Fraser,
"though he had a way with him, mind ye.  That
night in Inverness, Rob&mdash;that was a scene.
There was I dancing like a young yin, and all
to a scrap of a tune he was whistling something
like this..." and she tried to whistle, but
failed most signally.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Rob, "it was more like this,"
but he had not the twist of it at all.
</p>

<p>
"Ye're all out together," cried a voice in the
night.  "Was it no this?" and the west wind
carried the rhythm of the reel into the night.
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?" whispered Castleleathers,
looking about.
</p>

<p>
"It's no canny," said his wife with a shiver.
</p>

<p>
"Muckle John!" cried Rob.
</p>

<p>
The tune stopped, and suddenly as it were in
the midst of them with the ghastly thing over
their heads creaking and clacking, the voice of
Muckle John was singing, and these were the
words he sang:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Swing&mdash;swing in the hail and snow,<br>
  Dead banes clinkin' frae dawn to nicht,<br>
  Creak&mdash;creak to the hoodie crow<br>
  From rising sun to grey moonlicht.</i><br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>A lark soars blithe frae the sands o' Leith,<br>
  "Life's but a braw claymore," sang he.<br>
  "Death is nought but an empty sheath"<br>
  Creak, creak, creak, groans the Gibbet Tree.</i><br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>The waves gang jinkin' ower the shore,<br>
  A seagull laughs as he skims the sea,<br>
  But a feckless loon will laugh nae more<br>
  While he swings to and fro on the Gibbet Tree.</i><br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>The nicht creeps back o'er the cold grey tide,<br>
  The wind sighs over the barren lea,<br>
  Oh wad that the dark could for ever hide<br>
  The feckless loon on the Gibbet Tree.</i><br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>There comes a lad at the turn o' nicht,<br>
  "It's hereabouts that he said he'd be&mdash;<br>
  There's a ship at sea with a golden licht,<br>
  But no Muckle John 'neath the Gibbet Tree."</i><br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Swing&mdash;swing in the hail and snow,<br>
  Dead banes clinkin' frae dawn to nicht,<br>
  Creak&mdash;creak to the hoodie crow<br>
  From rising sun to grey moonlicht.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was above them up in the air or they were
going mad.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the song ceased and with a great
rattle of chains the gibbet's burden dropped
with a clatter, and at that Mrs. Fraser came
dangerously near to swooning for the first and
last time in her life.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-304"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-304.jpg" alt="WITH A GREAT RATTLE OF CHAINS THE GIBBET'S BURDEN DROPPED WITH A CLATTER.">
<br>
WITH A GREAT RATTLE OF CHAINS THE GIBBET'S BURDEN <br>
DROPPED WITH A CLATTER.
</p>

<p>
IT WAS MUCKLE JOHN!
</p>

<p>
"Good evening to you," he cried, "and rare
luck to the bride and bridegroom.  Well, Rob,
so it's fine to be a free man and a good ending
to a brave cause."
</p>

<p>
"But you, Muckle John&mdash;what of you?
Do you go to sea to-night?"
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," he said, and held Rob by the hand
for a moment saying nothing.  Then taking his
whistle from his pocket he broke into a jig, and
in the yellow light of the lantern he started
dancing under the empty gibbet tree.
</p>

<p>
It took doucer people than the Frasers to
stand still when that kind of thing was afoot.
Once again Rob and his aunt tripped it finely,
and Castleleathers, that mountain of flesh and
brawn, was not backward.
</p>

<p>
It was a strange sight that, with the forlorn
place, and the crying from the sea, and the
blinking weird light and the black figures
skipping like ghosts beneath a starlit sky.
</p>

<p>
They danced till all the breath was clean gone
out of them, and they stopped just because the
music was no longer there.  For unseen to any
Muckle John had stolen softly away playing as
he went, passing like a shadow, or a dream, or a
memory, into the vast darkness.
</p>

<p>
They stood for a space catching the lingering
notes of it, and then it was gathered into the
night, and became part of the sea, and the wind,
and the soft song of the rustling heath, and so
was gone.
</p>

<p>
And that was the last of Muckle John.
</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
